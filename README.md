I mean, why are you even here? who does that? anyway. this is the state of the repo before i let codex & claude refactor the shit out of it (heck, who new how to use the xml2 package??)
I left it here because im a nostalgic person and internet realesate is so cheap (free!).

god bless. thanks for putting the time to explore my work.
Happiness is only.. ok bye
