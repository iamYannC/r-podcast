And I admit I look at the calendar at the top of my screen as I record this, and I cannot believe it's July 30th already. We are almost in August, which means my kids are almost in which might be a little bit of normalcy for those parents out there,\r \r if you can relate to that. But, nonetheless, we're here to talk about all things are in our weekly. And I don't do this alone as always.

And, you know, give or take here here and there, but there are some\r \r fluffy efforts going on in various industries. So, yeah, you keep it real, Mike. You keep it real. That's what we do. That's all we do. And what else keeps it real? Well, it's organically real in terms of the awesome content at our weekly every single week. And as you know, we have a rotating set of curators that pitch in\r \r on different weeks to help, assemble the issue.\r \r\n\nAnd this week's our curator is John Calder,\r \r another one of our OGs, if you will, of the our weekly team. And as always, he had tremendous help from our fellow our weekly team members and contributors like\r \r all of you around the world.\r \r And our first highlight just happens to come from one of our fellow curators.\r \r And looking at this a phenomenon that unfortunately can occur\r \r when we grab our data from online sources and things get kind of uprooted from us, but the community\r \r comes to the rescue once again.\r \r This blog post is coming from Jonathan Carroll, who again, on top of his awesome efforts of our weekly\r \r is always looking at new things to learn in his blog. And it's always a fascinating read.\r \r\n\nWell, he's taken a bit of a detour from his programming language\r \r exploits and other languages. He's gonna talk to us a bit about the weather in Australia,\r \r and he's actually looked at this for quite a while now. In fact, since the mid 20 tens,\r \r he's been grabbing weather data from Australia that's been\r \r exposed by the Bureau of Meteorology.\r \r He says don't call it the bomb.\r \r I won't do that.\r \r But this has been keeping track of weather for a good while now.\r \r And but there's a bit of a bad news is that\r \r unlike other services,\r \r maybe you shouldn't be surprised about this. They may have an official API to download all this.\r \r\n\nSo Jonathan would leverage his scraping skills using the various utilities that we've covered\r \r many times in this podcast and elsewhere.\r \r There are many awesome packages in order to help with web scraping\r \r in particular, like the Arvest package, but there's many others in this space.\r \r Well, he's been doing that for a good bit.\r \r But there was a recent,\r \r mishap, if you will,\r \r where the service\r \r back in 2021,\r \r his function to do the scraping was not working anymore.\r \r No code changes. What gives? Right?\r \r Well, turns out as he did a little investigation\r \r in terms of user agents and other pits here,\r \r There was an official statement that was released.\r \r\n\nIt says, and I quote, the bureau is monitoring screen scraping activity on the site and will commence interrupting\r \r and eventually blocking\r \r this activity\r \r on this site from Wednesday, 3rd March 2021.\r \r Well,\r \r epic fail. Right?\r \r That's not good.\r \r And now, rightfully so, John's a little peeved about this because this is from a government site. You know, Australia, like other countries, we have taxes. We're open to pay the government from these kind of services. So\r \r oh, kinda throw your hands up on that one.\r \r Mike's biting his tongue here. I can tell there. Yep. Been yep. Yep. We've we've been there with these things getting uprooted\r \r from various sectors and government.\r \r\n\nBut\r \r the community comes to the rescue once again, unfortunately, where Adam Sparks, who's also been interested\r \r in weather data from Australia as well,\r \r he discovered yet another site that was kind of filling the niche of what was happening with the bureau site\r \r called silo.\r \r And he and Adam has built a new our package, which also is actually included in this our weekly issue\r \r called weather Oz\r \r and actually has an accompanying paper in the journal of, statistical software, the boots. So lots of lots of effort behind this,\r \r which helps have a compliant R package to grab the weather data from this silo site.\r \r\n\nTerrific. Okay. Back of business, John says. Now he can leverage this new package\r \r to have a very handy function called get stations metadata,\r \r which he's able to put in the station name\r \r and then which API to use. And by default, I believe it is a silo API.\r \r And sure enough, you get a tidy data frame back of the various metadata\r \r associated with this.\r \r And once you get the station code, then he can actually grab more of the data itself.\r \r And this is where he started now updating his functions\r \r to grab, you know, the various metadata associated with temperatures and whatnot, longitude, latitude,\r \r lots of other metrics here. I'm looking at the glimpse of the data frame here. There is a lot going on here. So if you're a weather junkie or weather nerd, this one's for you. There's lots going on in this space.\r \r\n\nSo he was able to grab almost 50,000\r \r observations\r \r over the last 135 years. So there you go. You got yourself some time series, if I do say so myself.\r \r So after a bit of tidying up, he decides, okay. You know what? I used to do some plots of this in the past as I was investigating some questions. Let me run these again. And sure enough with the new data and the tiny format, a little bit of g two code, and he's got a nice set of charts, Mike. Why don't you walk us through what he's trying to visualize here?\r \r\n\n[00:07:21] \r Mike Thomas"

        "trans_text": "Sure. So it looks like John originally had tried to create these chart charts\r \r using a package called Bombrang,\r \r which I was not familiar but appears to be be superseded,\r \r and now we're transitioning to ggplot, and I really really enjoy the ggplot\r \r code that he's written here. 1st, he's taking a look at the daily maximum temperatures and as you said, Eric, there is a lot of data here. We're we're going back, from 2024\r \r back to 18/89.\r \r So we have a scatterplot here with a beautiful curve on it, that shows, you know, has a different point for the day of the year,\r \r for each year between 18/89\r \r and 2024 and what the temperature\r \r was on the y axis,\r \r and we have some some color gradients based upon the decade\r \r as well, which I I think is a really\r \r unique and sort of interesting way to,\r \r add this additional dimension to the data as well. And it produces this really nice curve really beautifully done in g ggplot. We're we're using Viridis,\r \r to accommodate the color blind folks out there. So I can't say enough about this. It has a great caption on it as well. One of the things that I really appreciate,\r \r that John does, you know, throughout some of the other plots in this, chart\r \r is the use of I don't know if you would call them, like, Lambda functions for for additional filtering. But within the ggplot\r \r syntax you can pass,\r \r starting with like a a tilde a dplyr filter statement where the data frame itself that's being used by ggplot\r \r is, you know, referenced by this dotx placeholder.\r \r\n\nAnd there's multiple examples here in the code of how John goes about doing that and it's a really clean, nice syntax. It's probably something that I don't use enough.\r \r So if you are starting to get into, you know, a little more complicated\r \r ggplot visualizations,\r \r where in certain aspects of the plot or certain layers you you wanna use a portion,\r \r only a portion of the data and not the entire dataset,\r \r such as, in this daily minimum temperatures plot that John creates. He wants to highlight\r \r specifically in red so that these points stand out, you know, really really obviously\r \r to the user. All the observations,\r \r from June onward\r \r in the year 2024,\r \r so that you can see those really on top of the the rest of the Viridis, you know, gradiented,\r \r points on this daily minimum temperatures\r \r plot. And it's it's really\r \r simple\r \r syntax, I would say. Just this really nice dplyr filter statement and it's it's great that we have this beautiful concise\r \r interoperability\r \r sort of between ggplot and dplyr,\r \r to allow us to use those tools together to add these layers, you know, some that have a filtered context and and some that do not. Then we move into fastening as well where he has a daily maximum temperature plot,\r \r fasted by each month of the year. And one of the nice things here, again, is where we are,\r \r again, sort of calling out a specific point\r \r on each facet based upon a dplyr filter context where we're we're actually slicing the max, the the highest particular temperature across all\r \r 100 plus years, whatever that math is, between 18/89\r \r and 2004.\r \r\n\nAnd we're coloring that particular point red and we're sticking a geomtext label on top of it to let us know what year,\r \r that highest temperature in that particular fasted month took place in. So it makes it really, really easy to consume and take a look at this this chart to see the the temperatures,\r \r over time in a particular month, but then also call out the year that had the highest temperature\r \r in that month. It's it's really, really well done data visualization and he does the same thing, with the daily minimum temperature.\r \r And one sort of neat visual trick is that instead of,\r \r highlighting those those, you know, maximum\r \r or highest, temperature\r \r dots with the color red,\r \r as he did in the maximum temperature side, he will,\r \r highlight those with the color blue because these minimum temperatures are the the coldest temperatures,\r \r that that took place or that the year that had the the coldest temperature in that particular month I thought that was that was really nifty and something that I probably would not have thought to do but it's really interesting. And the the captions here and really the attention to detail\r \r are are beautiful and it's just a one of those really nice data visualization,\r \r blog posts, Eric, that I know you and I really love and appreciate because I'm a visual learner. This stuff stands out to me. Most of the work that we do for our our clients,\r \r ends or or, you know, utilizes some sort of data visualization as well to get our point across because it's it's one of the the ways that we communicate data the most effectively. So if you are just looking to either up your ggplot game or just get a little refresher and and take a look at what, John has put together here and some of his ggplot work. I can't recommend this blog post enough.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:12:24] \r Eric Nantz"

        "trans_text": "Yeah. It's such a great introduction\r \r to a very concise EDA with a novel dataset too and very logically exploring\r \r these trends that he has seen as the years have gone by.\r \r Can we see, like, a seasonal type pattern in terms of the variation of these temperatures? And, yeah, he has noted that it's been a\r \r 2024. Apparently one of these lowest points was a negative 5 degrees Celsius. And yeah, that's a bit chilly.\r \r And, someone who who's lived in Michigan over my formative years. Yeah. I know how cold things can get. But,\r \r yeah, it's interesting to see. Again, the facets really show the story of how the spread tightens in the middle of the year and then spreads more out at the extremes or, I should say, the beginnings\r \r and ends of the year. Yeah. Really, really novel use. Like I said, that way, I'm the like functionality.\r \r\n\nThe key point there is these geomes in these data arguments. As long as you're getting a data frame back, you don't have to do this pre computed in fashion. You can do it in line, so to speak, in the geo, which again is great, especially if you're doing this EDA and you wanna iterate on this pretty quickly and with some pretty concise code. So I think it's a novel technique that, like you, Mike, I have not utilized this enough.\r \r So I have to take a take a bit of learning here as I revamp my simulation\r \r or visualizations of simulations that we're trying to do a better job of these days.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:13:51] \r Mike Thomas"

Love it.\r \r You know, Mike, I always wonder if someone was kind of missing this year as the months have gone by. Well,\r \r there is a tradition\r \r that certainly a shiny enthusiasts are very eager to see happen, and it is back. What am I talking about?\r \r\n\nIt is the 2024\r \r shiny contest\r \r run by posit is officially\r \r up and underway.\r \r And this blog post comes from us from the author of shiny himself, Joe Chang, as well as our posit, community manager, Curtis Kephart.\r \r And then the blog post is pretty short and sweet. If you've familiar with the contest before, there's not a lot of changes. But if you're new to this, this is the annual tradition where they are reaching out to the community and inviting them to submit their entries of their innovative\r \r ways of creating\r \r and and deploying shiny applications.\r \r\n\nThere are a set of requirements to be aware of is that both the data and the code\r \r behind the app should be open source publicly available.\r \r So, obviously, it goes about saying you probably don't wanna use your company's internal data for this, but that's neither here nor there.\r \r And they also invite you to deploy the application\r \r on this time around\r \r the recently launched posit connect cloud service, which I believe just went publicly available a month ago or so. In the past, that's been Shiny apps. Io. But if I'm, you know, that's the usual evolution of a enterprise and their software products, I must say. And that you store the code in a public repository that could be GitHub, get lab, that bucket, whatever have you.\r \r And there is a set of judges, which I don't believe, you know, the names just yet, but there will be a set of judges that evaluate\r \r each of the applications based on a set of metrics.\r \r\n\nI speak a little bit of,\r \r experience on this because it was like a few years ago, I was a judge on one of these contests and\r \r my goodness,\r \r the submissions were such high quality. It was really tough.\r \r Great to see the applications, but, man, trying to find\r \r trying to judge these in a fair way when you just wanna say they're all great. Right? So it's a there's a set of judges to help compete with these metrics and a lot of nice awards at the end there with you are a runner-up or an honorable mention and the grand prizes. They have all the details there. Yes. There will be a bunch of stickers being thrown your way,\r \r and the grand prize winner actually gets a half hour\r \r private meeting with members of the shiny team. So my goodness. That's a that's an awesome opportunity in and of itself to go over your app and what you can do in the future.\r \r\n\nSo you may wonder\r \r where can I go to look? Well, I will say that but and the nice thing in this post is they've linked to the previous blog post where they talked about the winners\r \r and runners up all the way back to 2019.\r \r I still remember that you're very fondly of being like, okay. I'm all over this.\r \r I had fun creating a Lego mosaic app as part of a shiny contest of yesteryear. That was a that was a fun time. Of course, if you look at that code now compared to what I do now, just don't judge too harshly.\r \r But, nonetheless, it's a great time of year. We're always excited to see what the community comes, comes to bear with this. So,\r \r yeah, if you're a shiny\r \r and a shiny enthusiast, this is this is a great opportunity to test your might if you will and see what you can bring into the community.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:18:53] \r Mike Thomas"

I can I feel like there's\r \r so many more\r \r options\r \r in the shiny ecosystem\r \r nowadays and so many different sort of branches and paths that you could pursue as as you you know make your entry into this contest you know is it are you just going to have the the repository\r \r are you going to deploy your app somewhere is it going to be on shiny apps that I owe or is it going to be on shiny live right\r \r you know\r \r leveraging the web our framework are you going to use shiny for Python or are you going to use shiny for our or are you going to use that the teal framework for building shiny apps which is popular among folks you know in your space Eric and and farm on in life sciences\r \r and they did note that they are going to have a special recognition for developers\r \r shiny so if you were someone just getting started with shiny don't be intimidated by this contest actually embrace it because you could potentially get the the special recognition for for giving it a shot\r \r and I\r \r believe that that you will find if you are a new developer to shiny and you take place, in this contest and you participate\r \r in it, you know, one of the I think sort of where this is hosted is is the posit community? Correct. So I would recommend that you ask any questions that you have along the way within that Posit community forum. People are really responsive.\r \r\n\nI hope and I would, you know, based upon my experience, I think that you'll find it welcoming. I think that you will find, folks pretty responsive to a lot of your questions,\r \r especially, you know, within the context of of this particular contest and everybody\r \r trying to put their best work forward. So,\r \r welcome\r \r everyone, 1 and all. It's put your submission in. I think the deadline is, Eric, when did we\r \r when does it look like the deadline is? Let me take a look. I should know that. Check this out beforehand.\r \r Deadline for submission is September 15th at midnight,\r \r anywhere on earth.\r \r\n\nSo you've got a little bit of time. It looks like we've got about a month and a half here, if my math is correct, based upon the time that we'll put this, this episode\r \r out. So\r \r get to developing.\r \r\n\n[00:21:06] \r Eric Nantz"

And and certainly kudos to the shiny team and Curtis for\r \r working with, like like you mentioned earlier, this is the first time that we're really calling out the opportunity in the life sciences space to leverage the t o framework,\r \r which is making huge waves in our industry to help build these\r \r very comprehensive shiny ass of a modular structure\r \r that are tailored for reviewing the, you know, the types of clinical data that we deal with on a daily basis. So this is an awesome opportunity to see what you can do with that. And I've even seen others in the community that are not not necessarily part of pharma levers teal to do some really fun exploratory\r \r data analysis of a shiny front end. So, yeah, definitely, if you're a teal enthusiast,\r \r like, that's growing pretty rapidly. Yeah. This is a great opportunity to put your put your work out there as well. And certainly, like you mentioned earlier, for our friends in the Python space,\r \r Shawnee 1 dot over Python was just released. So another great opportunity if you've been wanting to test your mind with the Python side of things. This is a great place to do it. I always think in general,\r \r finding,\r \r a dataset\r \r or or a domain that you're interested in\r \r in and having an opportunity like this is such a great learning opportunity too. Because again, you're going to see\r \r not just your submission being put into the queue. You're going to see in real time as these submissions come in, there will be a post on posit community\r \r dedicated or a category dedicated to this contest and you'll see these start to trickle in and you get can get really inspired to see what what everybody's up to. So I remember\r \r going down to the wire on my Lego one and seeing just the, the, the high quality submissions\r \r and have admittedly a first time have low imposter syndrome. Like, oh my gosh, I can't believe this. But then again, I'm liking it to great learning opportunity\r \r and it's an, someone else will benefit from what you're putting out there. It always happens. So I remember\r \r getting some nice, comments on my submission, but then many others were providing\r \r questions and comments on these posts. So, again,\r \r very big emphasis on learning and having fun learning, I might add.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:23:17] \r Mike Thomas"

You can build what are called pre commit hooks in your local Git repository\r \r to help be that kind of frontline check before you actually do the commit.\r \r\n\nWell, there is a new package in your ecosystem called pre commit, which will let you author these pre commit\r \r hooks from the comfort of your r installation itself.\r \r And there is also, I believe, a little bit of requirement for Python as well.\r \r So this might be using reticulate under the hood. I'm not quite sure.\r \r But once you have everything set up, you're gonna be able to do, you know, a very nice, there's a nice package documentation site that we'll link to in the show notes going from the motivation of why you want to leverage this as well as some built in hooks that you can leverage\r \r such as for styling,\r \r such as making sure your read me is up to date if you're doing our markdown for your read me, making sure you're not leaving\r \r a browser statement in your code because who would ever do that? Oh goodness gracious. Who would ever push that into production? I don't\r \r know. My goodness. Where was this few years ago? But, yeah, there's a lot to choose from here, so,\r \r I may need this.

        "trans_text": "Yeah. You know, I I liken this to, you know, for those of you that follow pro wrestling, there are always that those days in the eighties where you didn't know that Hulk Hogan is really named Terry Beleja\r \r until, like, you were much older. Maybe it's just one of those reveals, like the gimmick the gimmick. The time's up for the gimmick, but nonetheless, we we know who you are, Mike, nonetheless.\r \r But, Yes. You've been you've been hard at work on these packages. So what Matt talks about in this post here is that\r \r he is leverage what Micah's created\r \r called the Nara package, which is\r \r basically super charging R's ability to produce raster based graphics, but\r \r tailor made to things like pixel art.\r \r\n\nAnd he, and Matt what Matt has done is he's augmented the narrow package tooling\r \r with his previous package called rogue like, which if you recall from a highlight episode probably 4 or 5 months ago,\r \r was a way in r to create these, in essence, randomly generated\r \r dungeon crawlers all in text based format. So you get a nice ASCII art of the dungeon with the layouts, and it would respond to your key presses\r \r to have you as the player with a little, you know, maybe p symbol in the middle there going up, down, left, right, and then the randomly\r \r generated enemies or other artifacts\r \r would move along alongside you.\r \r\n\nSo he simply now merged the ability to do this, but now instead of the textual representation of those dungeons,\r \r he is augmenting\r \r some nice retro style looking sprites here. In fact, he's leveraging\r \r an open source framework,\r \r from a,\r \r username Kenny.\r \r He has what's called a tiny asset pack of all these different sprite arts that are 16 by 16 pickle\r \r pixels. So\r \r really, really nice, and if you ever played those\r \r RPGs of yesteryear, like, say, dragon warrior or final fantasy, yeah, these are gonna look right at home\r \r in those in those artwork.\r \r\n\nSo how does this actually work? Well, as I mentioned,\r \r there is a lot of the underpinnings have already been made by Matt in this roguelike package,\r \r But now instead of the textual representation,\r \r he is mapping\r \r that mesh\r \r which basically is a matrix\r \r of, you know, 16 by 16 or whatever dimension\r \r where each cell has either\r \r a movable space\r \r or an obstacle,\r \r the player or the enemy.\r \r And so that's already randomly generated up the front, but then that is being trans translated into these tiles that are being created\r \r by the narrow package.\r \r So in the blog post, you see the textual structure of it, which again will look very similar to if you use Matt's roguelike package, but then that handoff\r \r is then translated, like I said, into this tile based\r \r board. And now you see the nice image\r \r going going under the matrix representation.\r \r\n\nIt just looks literally\r \r picked out of a retro game. It it really is\r \r absolutely amazing what's going on here.\r \r And you can do all sorts of things of this. Obviously, you can make this as big or small as you want,\r \r but there is a lot more that is coming, and that's, tooling here.\r \r He wants to make, you know, really a true loop of the game, which if you played\r \r RPGs or roguelike dungeon crawlers in the past, you know that as you move along the board, you get a random encounter with an enemy, do the battle, win or lose, rinse and repeat. But, of course, it's almost like an infinite loop per se.\r \r So he's looking at ways of having that true kind of gaming style loop\r \r in the back end here. And of course, like any RPG, you're gonna have it after your inventory at some point. Right? You gotta have those weapons, those potions,\r \r those antidotes when you get poisoned or whatnot. So,\r \r obviously, this is probably gonna be a huge rabbit hole if they choose to go down this route. But I am very much eagerly watching this. But, of course, the first major step is what the user actually sees.\r \r\n\nSo what's seen here with this, package that's Matt's created, he now calls a tile based. This is the start, folks.\r \r Like I said,\r \r who needs to pay for that unreal engine or that unity engine? Boot up your r console and go to town. Right, Mike? Absolutely. And it's you know, just reminds me of the old adage that\r \r\n\n[00:08:02] \r Mike Thomas"

This is reminding me of my Pokemon Blue game that I used to to play on long car rides quite often. Oh, yes. I think the graphics\r \r are are quite akin to that. It's it's pretty incredible that I think, as you mentioned, Eric, there's only\r \r like 4 they look like emojis, but I guess we're calling them,\r \r the these objects from\r \r a tiny asset pack which is some resource\r \r out there\r \r that has all of these different 16 by 16 pixels\r \r that you can use. I imagine that they're like Creative Commons licensed or something like that, which is why\r \r Matt chose to to use them and incorporate them and this whole entire game it looks like the graphics are just made from these 4 different emojis if you want to call that which is it's pretty incredible.\r \r\n\nThe idea that you know\r \r the the things that we're looking forward to here in the next iterations of this\r \r potentially could be, as you mentioned, a true game loop, a way to have some sort of an inventory system.\r \r The sound generation is really cool to be able to have some sort of a soundtrack\r \r to this game as well. I think I've seen some some more things from Mike FC coming out on Mastodon lately, if I'm not,\r \r if I'm not mistaken,\r \r around our packages that are doing some audio things.\r \r So maybe there's a potential chance that that could get integrated into this package as well\r \r but, you know, it's it's hard to do this justice in audio form. You really have to check out the blog post, see the visuals that are there,\r \r install the package from GitHub yourself, and try not to waste a couple hours,\r \r going down, you know, playing games in R. I I I dare you to try. And so this is this is really really cool stuff. I think it's a fun way to start off the highlights, this week, and I'm looking forward to what else is to come here. Yeah.

        "trans_text": "Speaking of trying things out, unless you've been living under a rock, you know that some of the biggest advancements in our world attack have been the use of generative AI and large language models to help with all sorts of things in our daily lives and especially in the world of software development.\r \r You've sure you've heard about efforts such as what Microsoft at piloted years ago with what's called copilot,\r \r which if you opt into that in your IDE such as visual studio code, also there are plugins to this with, say, our studio and whatnot. You'll get these, you know, auto completed like suggestions as you're typing out code. Maybe it's some boiler plate for a function call. Maybe it's helping flesh out some additional parameters or whatnot.\r \r Well, there obviously this space is moving quite fast and our next highway today talks about some recent findings\r \r that have been explored by the Epiverse team\r \r on their explorations of what's called the copilot workspace initiative.\r \r\n\nSo as I mentioned, this is coming from the epiverse blog. It's got a set of authors here. We got Joshua Lambert,\r \r James Azzam, Pratik Gupta, and Adam Kucharski. Hopefully, I said those right. They have teamed up here to talk about as they've been watching this space of how\r \r AI and LOM models are helping with development.\r \r What would be the what would be the situation\r \r of trying to leverage this new copilot workspace,\r \r which is kinda taking\r \r what was mentioned earlier by me in this copilot initiative to the next level\r \r and not just auto complete code as you're typing,\r \r but actually take a set of requirements that are surface Savia GitHub issue\r \r and just see how to actually produce the code or produce a solution to the problem at hand.\r \r\n\nSo they decide, let's do an experiment here. They teamed up with a group of professors and their organization\r \r to do 3 different experiments with this copilot workspace to see how it works in the real world.\r \r The first experiment, and they tried to go, I guess, from easy to difficult as we go through this\r \r is\r \r say, they have a function in their r package\r \r that has been internal up to this point, but maybe they got user feedback and says, hey. You know what? That's a useful function. Maybe we should export that.\r \r So using their epi now 2 package,\r \r they looked at an existing issue that was, again, was already filed about,\r \r hey, this function called epi now 2_cme\r \r c m d stand underscore model function\r \r should be exported.\r \r\n\nSo they let the copilot workspace turn loose on this\r \r and\r \r it did get the job done, albeit\r \r in ways that probably aren't as intuitive to an R user. So let me explain a bit by bit here.\r \r The Copilot workspace\r \r did determine that, oh, you know what? We need to replace that keyword of internal in the r oxygen documentation of that function\r \r and replace that with export\r \r and also having to update the namespace.\r \r Now there were some little shenanigans\r \r here because apparently it does change the formatting one of their other function arguments.\r \r I guess doing some text tidying up, which again, yeah, that's fine and all.\r \r\n\nBut in the end, it did technically get the job done.\r \r But this Copilot workspace is not intelligent enough to understand\r \r how documentation is updated with the modern r tooling for package development,\r \r such as using things like dev tools document\r \r or, you know, more natively of our oxygen to the re reupdate the name space dynamically. It did it itself manually like you would maybe in the early days of package development.\r \r Package development.\r \r So context itself, not quite there yet,\r \r but you can't say it didn't get the job done with this. It just did it in a much more\r \r manual fashion. So, you know, so far, you know, pretty promising.\r \r\n\nLet's take the difficulty up a notch, Mike, because now in the next experiment, they wanna add\r \r a new model\r \r to the package,\r \r albeit not too difficult from a complexity\r \r perspective, but this is upping the ante into what the Copilot workspace can do. How did this one fare? What do you think? Yeah. Not quite as well, Eric. They wanted to add what's called a simple epidemic model,\r \r\n\n[00:16:21] \r Mike Thomas"

So they, I believe, created a new issue if I'm mistaken, to add a basic SIR model, it's called, with a couple sentences on exactly what they were looking for.\r \r What happened was get Copilot created\r \r a script,\r \r a an R script\r \r with a naming convention that followed the naming convention of the other modeling scripts that they had. This one was, you know, within the R directory which was good\r \r and, the name of the script was model_sir\r \r which again, you know, follow the the naming conventions that they've used in this epidemicsr package\r \r that they have right now.\r \r\n\nAnd I think this follows a lot of sort of the the same things that I've seen, you know, over and over again with Copilot, with chatGPT,\r \r with some of this,\r \r it gets you close to the right answer and puts down, you know, some of the the the right things that you would want there, but not in the way that you would necessarily\r \r want that things organized,\r \r if you will.\r \r You know, so the code that was generated, you know, constructed that basic SIR model,\r \r used roxigeon 2 as as well,\r \r to document the code,\r \r but but a lot of aspects of the code, you know, didn't match what they asked for in that issue.\r \r The code contained what they call some inadvisable coding practices in R, you know, what we like to call code smells,\r \r and the model it self, you know, followed the standard set of of differential equations that are solved using the the desolve\r \r which is one,\r \r that they had actually requested\r \r in their issue, but it didn't have any options to input, you know, things that are are really important to them like interventions,\r \r which is, you know, what they the the Copilot\r \r had suggested that it would actually include but but failed to do so.\r \r\n\nThe other downside is that they they use the require,\r \r dissolve\r \r they use the require function to import the dissolve action,\r \r function package, excuse me, in the body of the generated code. And as you know, Eric, when we are developing\r \r our packages,\r \r that's not something that you want to include in your function. Right? Yeah. The smell was stronger that one. Oh, my goodness. That one stinks to high heaven.\r \r And you know, we use a lot of utility functions\r \r like from the dev tools and they use this package if we want to leverage a new package within our our package\r \r in\r \r a right in a proper way we could do you know use this use underscore package dissolve Right? And that'll add that to our description file.\r \r\n\nIt might add it to the namespace where appropriate.\r \r And obviously, we could,\r \r request the use of that package in our roxygen, right, import or import from\r \r code decoration\r \r above that particular function. So that's a pretty bad one right there as well.\r \r So you know a a few different code smells here. I don't think that the function itself accomplished exactly what they were looking for that model\r \r to do as well as, you know, some of the kind of ugly best practice\r \r things. So we're we're starting to head a little bit in the wrong direction here as we get into experiment 3.\r \r\n\n[00:19:44] \r Eric Nantz"

As you know, as you get, you know, maybe new features put in bug fixes or whatnot, you get that,\r \r point of eventual re release, maybe an update you wanna release on crayon or whatnot.\r \r You wanna have that code review to make sure that all the things are looking good. You're being efficient with memory usage, efficient with coding best practices.\r \r I always saw a little glimpse that, yeah, it may not be the best at coding practices.\r \r\n\nSo what they are expecting to see is hopefully in this issue of asking it to do the code review, they would have a documented set with, you know, links to particular snippets of code or maybe things could be\r \r optimized or maybe even just asking questions about the code or whatnot.\r \r Well, bad news is it didn't actually do any analysis of the code itself.\r \r It basically\r \r regurgitated\r \r some of the changes that were already described in the poll request\r \r and looking at change log, I e, from the news file and just kinda\r \r bundling all that together as a narrative,\r \r which in essence means that it does a great job of reading\r \r the news that is\r \r not so much looking at the actual code\r \r than the thing changes that could be made to make the code better.\r \r\n\nSo this is where, you know, humans aren't being replaced on this one by by a long shot.\r \r But what I do appreciate is a, they gave this, you know, 3,\r \r again, realistic use cases\r \r and not all difficult. I would say that the first one, the first experiment is definitely the easiest one, and it did get the job done.\r \r Just not in the way\r \r of you as an our developer\r \r wouldn't carry that out. So I think the takeaway here is that\r \r as we as I agree with them and their takeaways here, there's a long ways to go.\r \r There are avenues of success here, but I think you as the end user\r \r definitely need to be vigilant\r \r on making sure that whatever prompts or requirements you're feeding into these\r \r are being accurately,\r \r you know, addressed in the results you get. And if you're getting code back,\r \r yes, you definitely should not take that blindly, so to speak. You need to make sure\r \r does that fit your overall paradigm of a code base, your stylist,\r \r you know, your style guides, if you will, your best practices for your team.\r \r\n\nObviously,\r \r there's much more work to be done to make these, in my opinion, more dynamic so that\r \r as it looks at the code base for a package or maybe even a set of packages\r \r that it can really\r \r grok if you will.\r \r What are the key paradigms that are governing that code base instead of relying on a whole bunch of additional sources of who knows where it gets it with respect to this effort.\r \r I think being intelligent enough about what's actually being done in the project is is the way to go\r \r For research software engineering context, like what this is based on,\r \r yeah, maybe some help, but in the end,\r \r sometimes\r \r you you just can't get away from doing some of this manually\r \r right now. But this space is moving fast. And again, I really appreciate\r \r their their attention to detail\r \r to put it through the paces.\r \r\n\nBut in the end, I'm not I'm not moves asleep over the fact that the AI bots are gonna take over package development anytime soon.

        "trans_text": "And then rounding out our highlights today, speaking of refactoring things, you may have a situation\r \r where there are some things you could do manually,\r \r but then as you do it over and over again,\r \r especially as you're dealing with a large code base, maybe not even the one you wrote yourself,\r \r you wonder there's got to be something that can help me get there even faster.\r \r So our last highlight today comes from a frequent contributor, Myel Salman, from her recent blog\r \r about her recent journey\r \r to look at all the names of functions under defined in a script or set of scripts and a new approach that is new to her and frankly new to me as well.\r \r So this is fresh off the recent USAR conference where I'm seeing some of the videos of that come online, and it sound like it was a terrific event. Of course, I have a little FOMO every time I see that because I still haven't been to a user yet, but someday that will be checked off the bucket list. It just wasn't able to this year.\r \r\n\nBut one of the talks that my old discovered that she didn't see live, but she heard about after the fact\r \r is, Davis Vaughn,\r \r from the PASA team\r \r talked about a framework called tree sitter.\r \r What tree sitter actually is is a mechanism\r \r to parse code\r \r for somewhat like what we've heard in the past with things like abstract syntax trees and trying to parse either variable names, function names, or whatnot.\r \r Apparently, tree sitter is a c library and I guess maybe other libraries as well\r \r to help with that mechanism of parsing, you know, code intelligently.\r \r So her use case was a following is that\r \r she\r \r wanted to help out,\r \r finding\r \r wanted help finding functions\r \r in pat in, in the package eye graph. And if you know what an eye graph is, it's kind of like the standard bearer of doing network\r \r visual\r \r network, you know, data representation,\r \r which you can turn into network diagrams, you know, very much like tree setups are very\r \r intricate networks.\r \r\n\nI graph has a long history. We've covered it before on the show and it is a massive code base.\r \r So she wanted\r \r to have a use case of okay what functions and I graph\r \r now there is a certain operator that I graph has. It's like a bracket or square operator.\r \r She wanted to see\r \r how many functions were only using within this special operator.\r \r So she had to literally go within this operator function to find all the utility functions throughout.\r \r The example she has in the post only has a couple of them just for kicks, but imagine there's, like, a whole bunch of them.\r \r And she wanted to be able to she had to refactor these, but she wanted to or at least get to the point of refactoring them, And she didn't want to manually copy paste all these function names or discover them.\r \r\n\nSo\r \r she has used things like XML parse data in the past. We've covered on a previous episode\r \r of our expirations without the parse, a complicated function.\r \r She wanted to see what it'll look like with tree sitter to do that similar\r \r operation. So she talks about her for use case here. She loads the package,\r \r and then she loads the parser for the r language and that\r \r reads in that function text or that script that has the function text.\r \r And then she wanted to figure out, okay,\r \r where is the root of that tree that is now gonna govern all the child nodes\r \r of that function.\r \r\n\nSo\r \r this gets a little in the weeds here, but there is a function in tree sort of called query\r \r that you can feed in kind of a snippet of code that you wanted to look for.\r \r And there is like a little kind of YAML like structure to it. You define\r \r what's on the left side,\r \r what's on the right side, and you give it kind of like the plain text like label of that, wherever it's identifier,\r \r a definition,\r \r and then you kinda give it looks like a regex kind of comparison\r \r about what you wanna match it to. This is all news to me. I've never seen the tree sitter syntax before.\r \r But sure enough, when you run that\r \r and then you get a nested list back in r,\r \r that gives you the text of what it found\r \r versus the the actual text itself,\r \r the expression that's kinda more translated to the tree sitter notation of it. And then\r \r you've got\r \r you gotta step it away there. She didn't find the children functions yet,\r \r but guess what? There is more\r \r It's almost like you have to do a nested query to get to that point.\r \r\n\nYou then do the similar kind of syntax. You're looking at the left side and the right side definitions,\r \r finding another query of the previous query and then she was able to find\r \r the names of these different functions,\r \r again, internal functions\r \r that are in this Square operator. And that's a huge list that after that point.\r \r But then through some gripping to that, she was able to get\r \r all of those hidden function names\r \r in that square operator.\r \r There's about 5 or 6 of these in in\r \r intact, but this this all programmatically\r \r shouldn't have to look at all this herself.\r \r\n\nSo you can imagine if you scale this up to, like, a 100 times this size\r \r with a huge r package,\r \r this might be a great way to kind of do this kind of, like, unique query language\r \r with TreeSetter\r \r to get to what you need.\r \r Admittedly, I have never even ventured near these rabbit holes before,\r \r but I could see for our legacy Go base. And, again, I stress maybe one that you yourself didn't write as you're getting familiar of it. Because I've looked at iGRAPH before, and, yeah, there there's a lot going on under the hood on that one. So I wouldn't know where to look with trying to pick out these internal functions.\r \r Looks like tree sitter is something to to take a look at. And fun fact about tree sitter that I discovered after briefly looking at Davis's talk,\r \r this is being incorporated directly\r \r into posit's new IDE\r \r positron\r \r as part of its base for when you look at, say, the outline view of a script and getting those function definitions, which we've seen in our studio as well. But now I believe tree sitter is doing the heavy lifting to grab all those\r \r contexts around those functions. So it looks like tree sitter is here to stay for sure, but, what an interesting use case here to have to take a note of if I have to deal with legacy code based discovery in the future.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:32:34] \r Mike Thomas"

        "trans_text": "Yeah. Eric, I feel like Mal always brings us some pretty interesting use cases on the highlights. This is actually quite similar to a blog post that she authored\r \r a little while back where she did something very similar but,\r \r in XML\r \r instead using an XML parsed data\r \r R package,\r \r I believe. So this is if you wanna take a look at that blog post and this one side by side, I think it'll give you 2 different\r \r approaches to essentially doing the same thing.\r \r And it looks like there's about, you know, 5 or 6 different functions from the tree sitter\r \r package,\r \r that Maelle is is really leveraging here. And she does note that, you know, she went through a lot of different emotions as a beginner to this tree sitter package and not all of them were positive. One of them that I must have imagined taking a lot of tinkering with is where she does define that that sort of\r \r string that she's looking to to parse\r \r which involves, as you said, this this regular expression\r \r type of notation that we're looking at to try to,\r \r call out sort of the the particular function definitions that we're interested\r \r in here\r \r and being able to return that as a list that is is parsable.\r \r\n\nAnd so I think sort of the the chief different functions that she's employing from tree sitter after she does that are the the query, the query captures,\r \r and then, this node text which I I think sort of turn this list that gets returned\r \r into something that's a little more easily parsable, if you will, within r and obviously at some point in here we're leveraging per because, we are out outputting a list, the the map character function,\r \r to be able to break things down into just this final, you know, simple handful of of sip 6 different names of functions,\r \r that she's interested in. There is one footnote in this blog post. It says, no, I have not installed positron yet. So my l is doing this\r \r all from the RStudio IDE\r \r at this point. Yeah. But it's interesting to hear that TreeSitter is\r \r obviously gaining some some ground. I'm not sure how new in and of itself the the TreeSitter\r \r C utility\r \r is but it's something that we're we're new to seeing I think in the R Eco system as there's recently been some other blog posts as as you mentioned that you know the folks at Positron\r \r are using it as well. Well. So it's\r \r very interesting to me. Obviously, you know, I I could see if we have some large code bases where you have to do some sort of, you know, profiling of that that code base or extracting of\r \r of particular\r \r portions of that code in a way that just really isn't,\r \r you know, useful to do manually, the old copy and paste method, and it makes more sense to do that programmatically.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:35:23] \r Eric Nantz"

And I'm looking at this tree sitter repo, and I will put this in the show notes if you haven't heard of this before. Like, we didn't hear about this before. It looks like a pretty mature project\r \r of a lot of modern bindings,\r \r nonetheless, and they're trying to be\r \r dependency free to start. But then if you wanna hook it in the rust, guess what? You can. Wanna hook it in the WASM or web assembly? Yes. You can. Even has its own COI to boot. So there is a lot going on under the hood with this, and the best part is\r \r you can use this wherever you're comfortable with. It doesn't have to be in positron as you said. This could be in any r session. You can put it as on Versus code or whatnot. So, again, what I appreciate is, yeah, being able to learn about these discoveries, but then to be able to use this in my preferred environment. So this will be great. Again, I think the trial with a low friction way to get start and there's an r package now that has been author. We'll put a link to the r package itself in the show notes that ties ties all this together. But, yeah, you never I guess you'll never look at your code the same way again when you're looking in the forest, getting the forest from the trees or whatever it says.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:36:32] \r Mike Thomas"

Because but if you don't wanna track all the inputs in your app, you wanna be able to wait to exclude them but not have to exclude them name by name, you can now do a regex if you have all your inputs name of a certain prefix in front or whatnot that you don't wanna\r \r include in, you can, you can throw a reg X that way too.\r \r\n\nOther enhancements\r \r include\r \r actually tracking the errors that can occur in your app. And boy, that can be very helpful for diagnostics.\r \r Not that I would ever have an app that crashes. Wink wink.\r \r But also\r \r if you wanna take advantage of an unstructured database to put these metrics in or these uses patterns in, They now support from MongoDB, which, of course, is very popular\r \r for unstructured\r \r nested type data data representation.\r \r So lots more under the hood with that, but they also have updated their package documentation\r \r with 3 different vignettes all about the different use cases that you can have for shiny telemetry. So really kudos to them. Looks like a great package, and, yep, this is some idea with\r \r every single day.

We are finally back with another episode of the Our Weekly Highlights podcast.\r \r This is the show where we talk about the latest and greatest new packages,\r \r blog posts, other terrific resources that are featured\r \r in the highlights section of this week's Our Weekly Issue.\r \r My name is Eric Nance. And yes, we had a little bit of\r \r a break, both self\r \r imposed and some unexpected reasons for the break. But nonetheless, we were coming back hopefully refreshed. And,\r \r for me personally, I was able to take the family on a little road trip to Niagara Falls early in July. It was a spectacular time. And if you haven't been in that area, if you have the means to do it, I highly recommend that as a future vacation. It was a, I drove there, so that was a long drive, but\r \r made it through in one piece, which is sometimes a miracle in itself when you have 2 kids that are angry at, you know, on highways going through farmland as the Midwest typically is. But nonetheless,\r \r back here in the humble boat here, and I'm very pleased as always to be joined from my awesome co host, Mike, who's had his own adventures both good and probably not so good lately. But, Mike, how are you doing? I'm doing well, Eric. I am as equally impressed in your r and shiny skills as I am in your skills taking your family halfway cross country,\r \r\n\n[00:01:24] \r Mike Thomas"

        "trans_text": "Absolutely.\r \r Yeah. I was I was thinking, yeah, just doesn't seem right. No. All is right with the world. It's a great recording session with you. And we've got a couple awesome highlights to talk about today. And this issue\r \r has been curated by Batool Almarsakh, another one of our longtime contributors to the rweekly project. And as always, she had tremendous help from our fellow rweekly team members and contributors like you all around the world for poll requests and other suggestions.\r \r So let's\r \r dive right into it. And our first highlight today is a callback from something that we\r \r put the spotlight on in episode a 156.\r \r\n\nYou can check out the back catalog for that. But,\r \r you know me, and if you heard the podcast recently,\r \r I've been\r \r espousing my,\r \r affection and really big enthusiasm\r \r for web assembly and web are in the world of our and web development.\r \r And there are a lot of different ways to spin this now. We've been historically talking about\r \r the amazing work that George Stagg at at Posit's been doing with the WebR package,\r \r the web assembly framework tie ins with WebR\r \r is just immensely powerful.\r \r But there are some other perspectives that you can take\r \r and really massage these tools to do some interesting use cases.\r \r\n\nAnd way back in episode 156\r \r earlier this year, we had talked about Colin phase adventures\r \r with building his own rappers on top of WebR\r \r and combining with no JS to kind of fill a perspective\r \r of how to efficiently\r \r expose\r \r functions and are from say in our package,\r \r what looks to be native functions\r \r and a no JS runtime.\r \r And so we got some follow-up on that in our first highlight today because, yes, Colin Faye is back at blogging his recent updates\r \r to his web r COI and spider utilities,\r \r encoded up in in JavaScript\r \r to help with this perspective\r \r of exposing\r \r these great R functions that you can compile with web R into a no JS runtime.\r \r\n\nSo what's new? Well, as usual, as you get things bootstrap for the first time and you start iterating on it, you see some ways to make things more efficient and also\r \r helping the new user get onboarded more efficiently.\r \r Their first of which is that\r \r the web are COI package\r \r combined with spider will help bootstrap a template file\r \r for you to start that kind of boilerplate integration\r \r of the R functions from a package into the node JS runtime.\r \r And he's been able to simplify\r \r the template a bit so that it's about now maybe what 10, 11 lines of code.\r \r And he's hopeful that even if you're not an expert at JavaScript just yet, they'll be able to grok what's happening here. And I dare say he's got,\r \r he's mission accomplished on making that a lot more\r \r easy to grasp. I mean, he\r \r decomposes the explanations of the template in the blog post\r \r where there is a bit of setup to initialize\r \r these spider projects that's gonna help with the hand off, help with that integration,\r \r and then helping to import the r functions that have been bootstrapped into\r \r the directory where this project is being bootstrapped from. And then you can see then for a simple hello world example,\r \r you just put a prefix of our funds\r \r dot hello underscore world if that's the name of your r function,\r \r And there you go. Now you just called\r \r that r function from JavaScript.\r \r\n\nAnd what's interesting about that actual execution of it is that this actually doesn't need our at that point to do the execution. It's all already been pre compiled\r \r\n\n[00:05:37] \r Mike Thomas"

No. That that's that was probably the most interesting part of this whole article to me\r \r is that there's no R session running while the Node. Js app is running. It it's the spider package imports an R function\r \r converted to a native JS. So I guess that must happen beforehand.\r \r\n\n[00:05:57] \r Eric Nantz"

        "trans_text": "That's my understanding is in that bootstrapping process as you initialize a project. I believe it's compiling all that in in that initial pre step. So then the Node. Js side of it when you're just executing these functions,\r \r it's treated no differently than any other JavaScript function you would run-in that. That's just, again, amazing to me. Mind blown. 101. Yes. And Colin does it again. We we should be used to this by now from him after all the GOLM exploits, but, boy, he always teaches us something new.\r \r And then other tidbits in the post here that I think are gonna be great from a reproducibility\r \r standpoint\r \r and efficiency\r \r is kinda taking a page of how we do dependency management\r \r is making sure\r \r that when you bootstrap a WebR COI\r \r project\r \r that it will store\r \r the packages that are being installed in a packages dot JSON file\r \r so that then\r \r if you say move this to another computing environment or whatnot, as long as you version control that lock file, that JSON file, not to dissimilar what you would do with our end than the typical r setup, It'll bootstrap these these packages\r \r back down if they're not installed already. So I think that's paving the way for more efficient dependency management in this new workflow.\r \r\n\nSo he's got a nice schematic towards the end of the post where he kind of shows the workflow in a nutshell,\r \r which I believe is gonna be kind of the source of some\r \r additional documentation that he plans to author as he wants to have more than an end of one of users for this framework. He claims he's the only one using it. I highly doubt that. I'm sure there are others that are putting it through the paces. But he's got some other future items that I'm gonna keep an eye on for this is that\r \r in terms of reproducibility,\r \r he wants to make sure that when you initialize these projects\r \r that you can actually specify\r \r the web r version\r \r itself\r \r during that bootstrapping\r \r process. I mean, that will be, again, huge as web r takes more fruition as companies or organizations\r \r start to use this\r \r in critical pipelines\r \r just like with r itself. You wanna be to say, okay, I built this on web R version, you know, 4 dot whatever. I want to make sure that I can standardize on that for the future.\r \r\n\nAnd another tidbit I'll keep a close eye on, we've seen George Stagg mentioned he's been plugging in ways\r \r to install\r \r package, you know, WebR\r \r compliant our packages from our universe.\r \r That's been a new thing that he and your own have been working on. Colin wants to make sure that in this framework, in the WebR CLI,\r \r that you can install WebR compliant r packages from our universe as well. That will be massive for opening the door for additional functionality,\r \r down the road. So sounds like he's not stopping anytime soon with this. So I'm very curious where he goes. And again, the perspective here, I think, is definitely important, especially\r \r as many in in software development, you know, data science pipelines,\r \r you may have a team that is writing very intricate, very powerful code via our functions and hence our packages.\r \r\n\nAnd maybe they have the luxury\r \r of a separate team that's doing all the web interface layouts in their preferred JavaScript framework.\r \r This is tailor made for that scenario. The data science team can configure the business logic and r and doing all the powerful model fitting and everything.\r \r And then they just give this\r \r compiled with WebR COI to the web dev team. They're they they're no worse for wear so to speak. They just call it like they would any JavaScript function. I think it's gonna open a lot of possibilities for, again, using WebR and WebAssembly\r \r\n\n[00:09:50] \r Mike Thomas"

        "trans_text": "in even more context than initially we realized. Are you insinuating that the web dev team won't be writing in Shiny?\r \r What?\r \r No. You know, I I think one of the really\r \r interesting things that's going starting to go on right now, and obviously Colin is one of the folks who's spearheading\r \r that effort, is we have pretty good frameworks for building, you know, what, Eric, you and I call, like, production grade\r \r Shiny applications,\r \r right, that have a have sort of a dedicated server,\r \r component to them.\r \r And now that we're moving on to to WebR and Shiny Live and things like that, that dedicated server kind of goes away. But, you know, up until till now, and I I don't think we're quite there yet,\r \r a lot of the,\r \r you know, things that you really need to go from, you know, just a a toy POC\r \r app to production, like, you know, environment variables and authentication and and things like that haven't really existed in in this new WebR and Shiny Live world, but it seems like we're slowly but surely starting to get there and maybe there is a day coming.\r \r\n\nI don't know how how near or far in the future where essentially everything that we can do in in WebR,\r \r is equivalent to what we could do, you know, with the\r \r old, quote, unquote\r \r framework for for building Shiny apps with a dedicated server. And and as Colin notes, I believe it's in his WebR CLI\r \r utility that there is a share n,\r \r function that allows\r \r the user to copy 1, several, or all environment variables\r \r from node to the WebR\r \r instance, I think, which is is really interesting. It's really important. I don't really build any Shiny apps these days\r \r that don't,\r \r leverage environment variables for, you know, secure authentication to a database or or something like that.\r \r\n\nSo that's a huge, you know, hurdle that I sometimes need to need to get over when we're looking at new frameworks\r \r like this. And it looks like, you know, Colin's already thought about some of this stuff, to be able to help us out when we we do get to that point. And I have not dove too deep yet, admittedly, into WebR and and Shiny Live. But, yeah, besides seeing what others in the community, like yourself, Eric, are doing,\r \r and building, but I am pretty confident that it's it's not gonna be too far in my future where I'm I'm not gonna necessarily have a choice and and going to have to start, learning about that because I think that there are quite quite a lot of benefits here depending on your use case,\r \r to to leverage that that WebRamp framework. And it's just getting better and better\r \r every every month, every day, every week, it seems like.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:12:29] \r Eric Nantz"

Read it now because it's gonna be something that I think I'll be able to benefit from very quickly. Yes. I this is a new world to us\r \r as I've been, you know, thinking about framing my talk for the upcoming positconf, and I talk about our adventures of WebR and WebAssembly\r \r and your consortium pilot submissions. I've always been trying to think of an intuitive way to describe\r \r this paradigm shift. Maybe it's not so much a paradigm shift, but it is a\r \r traditional server side hosting process to what is now being exposed.\r \r\n\nIn essence, the user's web browser is the new engine. It's the new server. That's where everything's being\r \r conducted.\r \r And what are the benefits and trade offs of that? A lot of benefits that we're seeing. I mean, you've heard me mention on previous episodes or we're seeing in quarto,\r \r what we're seeing and be able to build these educational type materials\r \r showcasing\r \r the the native execution of our code so the users cannot just see examples,\r \r but literally play with it in their browser\r \r without that need of a shiny like server on the back end. That's still one of those use cases that I think is just beginning to really take fruition.\r \r And I think it's just\r \r only a matter of time as those principles get built into what we're doing in data science pipelines\r \r that we've historically done with shiny and still, of course, who's the number one fan of shine wearing their t shirt today for goodness sakes. Of course, I love my shiny and to be able to combine it with WebR. I mean, that's still this intersection that I'm very passionate about and certainly to be abreast of this technology,\r \r abreast of what we can do in this space.\r \r\n\nThings of what Colin's doing here with WebR CLI and Spider\r \r along with the adventures that Bob Rudis has had on his various blog posts and what he's been doing with WebR. He's been just as excited about this as anyone else. So it's great to be well rounded into, like, the different ways you can spin\r \r this technology.\r \r And, again, the end product,\r \r you're gonna be able to build these very sophisticated\r \r web our web assembly powered apps\r \r in many different frameworks. That's the key here. Right? We're opening so many doors for every teams to get into this. So, yeah, I'm it sometimes be it sometimes makes me shake my head just how fast this is moving. But once that initial hurdle got overcame last year,\r \r with bringing WebR\r \r to the r, you know, web assembly to the r process itself,\r \r the floodgates have opened, and I'm here for it. Me too.\r \r\n\nAnd rounding out our highlights today, we're gonna dive into the world of spatial visualizations,\r \r which we touched on quite a few times with some of the amazing efforts\r \r in the art community to expose some very powerful frameworks\r \r in the mapping and geospatial\r \r space. And we got another highlight\r \r that is actually more of a function that's exposed into an overall effort that I think is gonna be very important for those that are looking to take advantage\r \r of innovations and web technology\r \r in the spatial visualization\r \r space into there are processes.\r \r\n\nCertainly, this has a nice fit for shiny too that we may touch on as well. And we're talking about the mapgl\r \r package,\r \r which has been authored by Kyle Walker who has been featured on previous Arrukia highlights in the past. He runs, I believe, his own consulting company. We're gonna do a lot of spatial visualization\r \r analysis and visualization,\r \r and the map GL package.\r \r This looks\r \r really nifty to me because\r \r it is, Mike, many in the HTML widget ecosystem\r \r trying to get the our user and intuitive interface to an extremely powerful web based visualization\r \r platform.\r \r\n\nAnd there are 2 of them to be exact that this package exposes.\r \r It's the Mapbox GL and the Map Libre\r \r GL mapping services.\r \r They age are slightly different, but yet they're very important use cases\r \r and map GL is a framework to bring that to the our user\r \r very efficiently.\r \r And, Mike, I don't know if you had a chance to look at their getting started vignette that Kyle has on the website.\r \r Holy moly. Some of the visuals he can produce in this are extremely powerful here. Yeah. It's absolutely incredible, and I've seen Kyle quite active\r \r\n\n[00:17:09] \r Mike Thomas"

        "trans_text": "think, you know, one of the things that folks doing, you know, pretty heavy geospatial\r \r data science,\r \r run into sometimes\r \r is performance because there's a lot going on on screen when it comes to geospatial data. The data can be large in and of itself and sort of heavy when your your data is representing polygons and things like that, not just\r \r individual points.\r \r And then obviously the the visual component as well. Right? Your maps are are complex\r \r visualizations\r \r and\r \r traditionally maybe not the the quickest visuals\r \r to render. But what we're seeing out of the the mapgl,\r \r package right now that Kyle his team have put together is some incredible enhancements, and it looks like those underlying APIs,\r \r though those services have have done a lot of work to try to make, these\r \r geospatial visuals as performant\r \r as possible. And one of the ones, you know, that we're calling out today in the rweekly highlights is this compare function,\r \r from mapgl.\r \r\n\nIt allows you to\r \r create a comparison view between 2 Mapbox GL or map libre\r \r GL Maps and what it'll do is it'll provide this sort of horizontal bar\r \r in the middle of the visual itself that you can drag to one side or the other,\r \r to be able to expose\r \r more of either the left map or the right map, and compare those 2 sort of side by side. This is something that, we have actually done, you know, quite a bit when we have sort of an overlay often of of the same,\r \r geographic\r \r area,\r \r but we're trying to\r \r maybe represent, you know, 2 different,\r \r you know, data\r \r sets on top of that same geographic area. So maybe 2 separate surveys in the same area,\r \r something like that, and you're comparing,\r \r one to the other. So you have those things side by side and you can go go left and right, 2 different simulations,\r \r you know, of, an ecosystem or something like that. That's things that we have done in the past leveraging that compare slider widget in the leaflet ecosystem\r \r and this seems to be pretty comparable\r \r to a function\r \r in leaflet called add map pane.\r \r\n\nI don't know if there's a more recent one but that's the last time that I was working, with leaflet on exactly that that type of problem. We were able to create like a left map and a right map and the function that we used was add map panes. This looks, this compare function from mapgl\r \r looks quite equivalent to that.\r \r Again, you know, these maps look beautiful. The ability to drag left and right is something that, users of our apps that have done that when we've implemented it in leaflet\r \r have absolutely loved.\r \r I I think it's probably one of the the the most favorite pieces of functionality\r \r that our end users\r \r let us know that they really like on our geospatial data science project. So it's pretty cool to see that also exist here\r \r in, the mapgl GL package. And, you know, from everything that I'm seeing,\r \r if you did wanted to migrate from Leaflet to, you know, this map GL package, it looks fairly straightforward. A lot of the syntax, a lot of the,\r \r arguments to some of these functions look quite similar.\r \r\n\nAnd obviously, the visuals at the end of the day aren't necessarily too far apart. So you may be able to to migrate fairly quickly and and pick up some of those performance gains that it looks like MapGL\r \r is able to offer or maybe there are just some aspects of MapGL that sort of make more sense, to you,\r \r to use,\r \r as opposed to, you know, the traditional leaflet or other geospatial packages. So if you haven't had a chance to check it out and take a look at everything that Kyle and his team have put together in mapgl,\r \r I highly recommend it because it is looking like quite a powerful\r \r R package that I I believe is gonna rise to the to the surface here pretty quickly within the r ecosystem.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:22:08] \r Eric Nantz"

This is definitely something if I was getting in this field, I would take a close look at because I always have a bias towards towards\r \r those packages that are putting attention to detail in that user experience of getting onboarded quickly. So on top of the getting started vignette, he's got a great section on how to efficiently use the wear layering system, which again, be very familiar to anybody coming from these special packages,\r \r the fundamentals of how to design your maps with mapgl.\r \r\n\nAnd, yes, he does mention one of his original motivations was to plug this into shiny in the first place, and he wanted to put all this into a concise package\r \r that then could be sourced in the shiny quite easily. And he's got a whole vignette\r \r dedicated to that about the inputs that are being exposed. So, of course, Mike Mike and I know you can do almost anything you want with shiny once you get access to these inputs. So he's got a couple great, great little, teaser\r \r apps in in the vignette that you can get started with. So I think, yeah, this is something that we'll be we'll be paying close attention to in this space. It's all open source. So if you feel so inclined to get involved yourself, there's there's 7 issues out there that I'm sure Kyle would,\r \r appreciate some help on. So definitely check it out. Absolutely. So, again, links in the show notes and, yeah,\r \r I'm really impressed with what Kyle has accomplished here.

I'm talking about a video that he's put into the issue.\r \r\n\nWhy as an our user,\r \r you might want to invest into using GitHub actions.\r \r So it's a great 20 minute video and it's,\r \r great if you're new to this. Because I think a lot of people may have heard about GitHub actions, but they just don't know where to start. They don't know what's in it for them. Bruno does a terrific job of summarizing it. I will mention, now this may be not so much applies to his video, more of my random exploits.\r \r The bugging GitHub actions can sometimes feel like you're in the wilderness without any line of sight, and I\r \r had that a couple times in the last couple of weeks where I was, troubleshooting,\r \r get a failure, don't know why, rinse and repeat.\r \r\n\nThe YAML is like the engine to the GitHub actions that there's a YAML file where you put in all the steps of your workflow and any\r \r associated parameters. So hopefully,\r \r the teams behind these different steps have good documentation and unfortunate that most of the workflows I was using were authored by EverPosit or other members of the community where it was pretty\r \r pretty well easily understood how to grok the options and stuff. But sometimes when you try to do things a little different, be prepared for a little debugging time. But once you get it working,\r \r my goodness, the peace of mind to say, okay, guess what? That's gonna run like once a week, and that's gonna run on every PR.\r \r\n\nI'm doing this with shiny testing recently. I finally got it working.\r \r I was an achievement unlock with shiny test 2 and GitHub actions, but I finally cracked that nugget. That's just one way you could use GitHub actions. Well, like I said, lots of different ways you can use it from, like, you know, automated processes or scraping data\r \r from an online source. I do this with that fancy,\r \r podcast index dashboard that was a runner-up in the table contest recently. So I've been putting that, putting that through the paces quite a bit, but it's been a fun learning journey for me. So Bruno does a terrific job of highlighting that in his video. And I'm not sure if we touched on it last time we spoke because it's been a little while, but congratulations on your runner-up and in the table contest. Your your app was awesome.\r \r\n\n[00:26:20] \r Mike Thomas"

It's really cool to see the community sort of come together\r \r for things like that, which is awesome.\r \r One of the blogs that I wanted to shout out is is one from Absalon this week, and it is on the power of transitioning to a\r \r verse approach in your r package development.\r \r It's, you know, it was a really interesting blog post about, you know, whether you\r \r should take the packages that you may have developed internally\r \r and create a sort of tidyverse or pharmaverse\r \r around them that would allow you to install,\r \r multiple\r \r of those packages\r \r at one time. And they talk about sort of the pros and the cons of that. Right? Obviously, if there are\r \r sort of\r \r breaking changes,\r \r in one package, then you might,\r \r you know, sort of be be hit by that a little harder if you are sort of\r \r leveraging this verse approach in a lot of your applications. But,\r \r they they call out companies like Apple that choose to introduce on purpose breaking features with every other OS\r \r iteration,\r \r you know, and they sort of effectively\r \r eliminate their need to support the legacy\r \r software that they create.\r \r\n\nSo it it sort of depend That hurts, but it's so true. It sort of depends how much you wanna support your your legacy software and your your legacy products a little bit. How,\r \r sort of what the benefits would be for your end users if they were able to, you know, install dot packages from a a verse as opposed to specifying\r \r each one individually\r \r every time. I have mixed feelings about this, but I can definitely see some particular use cases where it would make sense and and some particular use cases where it wouldn't make sense. So it was a really interesting read. It's, sort of a topic that I haven't seen discussed very often, so kudos to the Appsilon team.\r \r And in particular,\r \r Fabian He for putting that blog post together. I will do sort of a self indulgent shout out as well.\r \r\n\nWe had a R package that got a very significant update after 3 years, I think was the last release. It's called migrate for building state transition matrices. So if that's something that you you do, if you work in an insurance or credit risk or something like that, Maybe of interest to you, some pretty exciting enhancements there. Oh, congratulations,\r \r\n\n[00:28:44] \r Eric Nantz"

But, yeah, it was my\r \r my turn on the docket. So as usual, I'm doing these curations in\r \r many different environments, Mike. You're gonna learn this as your,\r \r little one gets older. You gotta be opportunistic\r \r when the time comes.\r \r And I was curating this either at piano lessons or swim practices\r \r or whatnot, but it ended up getting curated somehow. So we got some\r \r fun, great post to talk about today. Never as short as a great content to draw upon.\r \r\n\nBut as we always say in these, in these episodes,\r \r the curators are just one piece of the puzzle. We, of course, had tremendous help from the fellow curator team\r \r on our weekly as well as all the contributors like you around the world who are writing this great content and sending your poll requests for suggestions\r \r and improvements.\r \r So we're going to lead off. We're going to get pretty technical here in a very\r \r have\r \r in many different domains that honestly\r \r you would least expect.\r \r But we're gonna talk we're gonna go to the moon a little bit here, Mike. Not quite literally, but we're gonna see\r \r how\r \r R with the suite of packages authored by none other than Tyler Morgan Paul, who is the architect of what we call the raverse\r \r suite of packages\r \r for 3 d and 2 d visualizations\r \r in R.\r \r\n\nHis blog post as part of this highlight here is talking about how to use r to produce not just images of the moon and other services,\r \r but very accurate looking images with some really novel techniques that\r \r I definitely did not know about until reading this post.\r \r So I'll give a little background here, but\r \r when you look at graphics rendering and you'll see this in all sorts of different domains, right, with, like, those\r \r CGI type movies or images or, you know, animations,\r \r of course, gaming visuals and whatnot that have to do with some form of polygons.\r \r Little did you know, little did I know at least, that the triangle\r \r geometric shape is like the foundational building blocks of many of these computer graphics,\r \r which gets you\r \r really long ways,\r \r but it's not as optimal when you have to\r \r render a surface that is on 2 different sides of a spectrum.\r \r\n\n1st,\r \r maybe something that looks\r \r completely smooth. No artifacts.\r \r No, you know, jagged edges or whatnot.\r \r Or the converse of that,\r \r something that has unique contours,\r \r unique bumps, if you will, such as, say, the surface of the moon with its craters and other elevation\r \r changes.\r \r Now there are 2 primary methods that Tyra talks about here that can counteract\r \r kind of the phenomenon of these triangles not really being optimal for this rendering.\r \r One of these is called subdivision\r \r where, in essence, these polygons are subdivided\r \r further into micro polygons\r \r often smaller than a single pixel, which means we're blurry looking at something small here to help bring a smoother appearance with tweaking a certain parameters.\r \r\n\nAnd then on dealing with the converse of that, again, like dealing with bumpy surfaces or contours,\r \r you have what's called displacement\r \r of the vertices of these associated\r \r polygon\r \r to help bring this kind of artificial\r \r detail to the surface that, again, mimics\r \r what you might see in the real world with these contoured\r \r surfaces.\r \r And Tyra says that the Raver suite of packages now\r \r have capabilities to handle both of these key\r \r algorithmic kind of explorations or rendering steps\r \r to make these more accurate looking visuals.\r \r And as I think about this, as we walk through this example here, I harken back.\r \r\n\nAgain, Eric's gonna date himself here to my retro gaming roots where\r \r I remember very distinctly.\r \r It was in the, you know, early nineties, maybe mid nineties\r \r that the local arcade started having these racing games that\r \r were not those, like, sprite filled racing games like the yesteryear, like Out Run or whatnot.\r \r I remember vividly Sega making a game called virtual racing, which was on the first times I had seen in an arcade\r \r really robust looking\r \r racing cars in 3 d type perspectives,\r \r but you could tell they were made with polygons.\r \r And they were smooth. Some were smooth, and yet some are really jagged as heck when you went out crashes or sparks, and you could kinda see if you, like, if you had a pause button in the arcade, you can see these little artifacts that appear\r \r that look like little geometric shapes.\r \r\n\nAnd in essence, that's what can happen when you render\r \r an image in the beginning, and he's got an example where he basically renders what looks to be,\r \r kind of like a cross between a sphere and a hexagon\r \r in a 3 d contour\r \r and then a,\r \r cube and then the r logo.\r \r But when you render this first of a few parameters that he does with one of his, packages,\r \r you can see, yeah, they're little polygon shapes. They look like what I would see in that kind of first attempt at that virtual racing game.\r \r But then he starts to show example code, again, new to the ravers\r \r of called subdivide_mesh,\r \r this function which lets you define\r \r just how deep you do this subdivision.\r \r\n\nAnd he starts with levels of 2, and then he, you know, re renders the image. And now, in the second image, you look the left image.\r \r Again, you want to look at this as we're talking through it if you have access to the screen.\r \r That first, ball on the left looks like the Epcot\r \r center\r \r or a golf ball and, on on the golf course. You can tell. You can see those little triangles splitter throughout, which is not what he wants. He wants to make this look completely smooth.\r \r So\r \r guess what? It's all iterative in these steps.\r \r He tries another subdivide mesh call\r \r with, you know, first trying to make things look a little more smoother\r \r without going new subdivision\r \r levels,\r \r and it doesn't quite get the job done. They still look, you know, a little bit off, but he's rounded out some of the edges to that aforementioned cube,\r \r but he's still gotta go deeper. And, basically,\r \r he finds this sweet spot\r \r of, like, subdivision levels of 5,\r \r which means\r \r this is upping the count on these little small triangle\r \r shapes that are composed in each of these images.\r \r\n\nAnd going from the start to finish of this,\r \r that added\r \r many, and I do mean many additional triangles to each of these shapes as compared to what he started with. It's a huge increase, and, in fact, it was a 1024\r \r fold increase\r \r in these number of triangles, which may not be the best for your memory usage in your computer, although I there are no benchmarks around that. But I know\r \r from my, you know, brief explorations and things like,\r \r what's a blender for rendering, 3 d and Linux and other software,\r \r that as you make these shapes more complex, yeah, your computer is gonna be doing a lot more work with that. So in the end of this example, he's got 3\r \r versions of the the rendered scene, what he started with, and then one in the middle, which is kind of like a compromise of like the subdivision levels\r \r and kind of moving some of these vertices around, and then the last one of using like all these triangles at once.\r \r\n\nThe good news is is that this shortcut approach in the middle, you can't really see a visual difference of the naked eye\r \r between that and the more complex version with the additional triangles.\r \r But the key point is that, a, Ray the Rayverse packages support this, and you're gonna have to experiment with it for your use case to get that sweet spot of the smoothness\r \r that you're looking for.\r \r So that was a great example how you want to give this kind of smooth appearance\r \r without those artifacts fault coming into play.\r \r Now, we turn our attention to the bumpier contour surfaces\r \r with, say, the moon as inspiration.\r \r\n\nAnd he mentions that this will be familiar to anybody who deals with GIS type data in the past with elevations.\r \r He has a nice render of both the moon image as well\r \r as, moderate bay where you can see the contours very clearly\r \r in the black and white images,\r \r And then he starts by drawing a sphere of what looks like the moon, but when you look at it, it just looks like a very\r \r computer graphic looking moon with, like, a shade on the left and light on the right, but you would not tell that's anything really.\r \r So then comes the additional\r \r kind of experimentation\r \r of,\r \r okay, how do we\r \r first\r \r figure out what is the current displacement\r \r information that's in that image so you can get a sense on what's happening here\r \r and how many pixels are being sampled to help do this\r \r rendering by default.\r \r\n\nSo there are some handy functions that he creates to kind of get into this metadata.\r \r And he notices that in the first attempt, there's only about point\r \r 0 9%\r \r of the pixels from that moon image are being\r \r sampled to produce this more artificial image,\r \r and that's why it's not looking like a moon at all at that point.\r \r So gotta up the ante a little bit. Again,\r \r kind of like a iteration\r \r of this\r \r to figure out, okay, maybe I need to use more\r \r pixels to sample in this. It starts going from like 1.4%\r \r of them,\r \r Still not quite looking right as you look at the post.\r \r Ups it further,\r \r and he's got a handy function called generate moon mesh that he kinda ups the levels 1 by 1.\r \r\n\nAnd eventually, he gets to a point where,\r \r hey, we're now we're getting to what looks like the craters on the image\r \r where about 5 or 6% of the pixels are being sampled.\r \r Still not quite there yet, but he ups the ante even more with this, levels. And then he finds what looks like,\r \r you know, a really nice looking moon where it ends up sampling about 89%\r \r of the pixels,\r \r which means that there is a lot going on behind the scenes in this image.\r \r And in fact, this would take up a lot of memory,\r \r And you can see there is kind of a there's a point of diminishing returns the more pixels you subsample here for this displacement.\r \r Not really a lot of change visually. So ends up, he finds a sweet spot\r \r between\r \r not going to the extreme of, like, 2,000,000\r \r pixels resampled\r \r somewhere in between.\r \r\n\nAnd hence, he's got a really nice visual at the end where you can see\r \r it it's getting getting much closer once he brings us back to the sphere shape.\r \r And there's a nice little phenomenon kind of towards the end where it looks like at each of the north and south poles of the moon,\r \r when you do it by default, it kind of looks like things are being sucked in like a vacuum. It's hard to explain.\r \r But then when he does the applying the contour more effectively,\r \r you see that it just looks like any other surface on the moon, nice\r \r little craters and whatnot.\r \r\n\nAs you can tell, I've been doing my best to explain this in an audio form, but what's really cool is that you can see\r \r kind of Tyler's thought process\r \r of when you have a problem he wants to solve with his raver suite of packages.\r \r These steps that he takes that go from start to finish,\r \r not too dissimilar to what I see many of the community do when they teach things like ggplot2.\r \r Start with your basic layer, start to customize layer by layer bit by bit until you get to that visual that you think is accurate given the data you're playing with. And in case a toddler's visual is here, to closely mimic what you might see if you put your telescope out there and look at the moon at night. So, again, a fascinating look to see the power of r\r \r in graphics rendering,\r \r which if he had told me this was possible 10, 15 years ago, I would have laughed in your face. But this is really opening the doors, I think, to many people making\r \r so many sophisticated\r \r images,\r \r not just in the 2 d plane but also in 3 d and really insightful\r \r walk through here. And you can tell when you read Tyra's writings\r \r just how much time and effort he's put into these packages\r \r to make all these capabilities\r \r possible. But yet with, you know,\r \r geological\r \r and very fit for purpose\r \r past.\r \r\n\nSo a lot to digest there, but, again, I think it's a very fascinating field.\r \r\n\n[00:14:20] \r Mike Thomas"

I think, you know, when the raverse sort of first came out,\r \r it was pretty revolutionary, I think, to the our ecosystem. You know, we had ggplot, and we could do, you know, a a lot in in ggplot and some of the other plotting packages that were available. But in terms of 3 d\r \r visualization,\r \r animations, things like that, you know, we never had\r \r anything like that as far as I know until Tyler came along. So these suite of packages in the in the Rayverse and in particular the ones that he's highlighting today and their new functionality are RayVertex\r \r and Ray render are pretty incredible.\r \r\n\nI have tried to do some of this myself in the past. I think,\r \r I think you can expect your laptop fan to to a little bit\r \r as you try to do this. So get your GPUs\r \r ready, if you're especially if you're trying to add, you know, additional complexity\r \r and do some pretty in-depth things within these packages. But the the fact that we can do this at all is is absolutely\r \r incredible, and\r \r I loved the callback to sort of your early, you know, eighties nineties video game experience because that is that exactly what a lot of this blog post reminded me of as he leverages that subdivision levels argument in the subdivide mesh,\r \r function.\r \r\n\nAnd you can sort of see how the the pixelation just starts to smooth out as that that number\r \r increases in terms of how many, subdivision levels\r \r are being used. And it's it's almost, you know, conceptually, like,\r \r following video game graphics from the eighties nineties to the 2000 as you sort of get away from these these triangles and the pixelation into something that looks, you know, much smoother,\r \r into the naked eye. You you really can't even see the pixelation\r \r at all.\r \r Great summary by you. I'm not sure if there's a whole lot more to add to it. It's an incredibly visual blog so it's difficult for us to do it\r \r spend a lot of time in, you know, 3 d visualization,\r \r I think you'll still find it fascinating.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:16:35] \r Eric Nantz"

But,\r \r I do think as you look at the evolution of these images, back to that racing example, it's like when I saw that virtual racing game back in the early nineties and, again, you could tell it was like Sega's, you know, first real attempt at making\r \r somewhat perform at Polygon renders.\r \r\n\nAnd then it was like a couple years later, those of you who remember that Daytona USA\r \r racer game, it looked real.

        "trans_text": "So Mother Duck is a way to run as far as I know. It's sort of a whole cloud based data warehouse system,\r \r or platform,\r \r from the developers of DuckDb themselves\r \r that allow you to not only store data, in the cloud but to also run DuckDV\r \r itself in the cloud so that you don't need DuckDV\r \r installed on your own laptop. You just need to be able to authenticate\r \r into your Mother Duck account that you have, and you can run, you know, serverless\r \r cloud based analytics\r \r using DuckDb,\r \r but not needing anything installed on your own laptop which is is really cool besides, you know, the the packages to authenticate\r \r into it. So currently,\r \r and and, you know, one big component of this that that's noteworthy that I think we should touch on is DuckDV just released version 1.0.0\r \r on June 3rd.\r \r\n\nSo this is\r \r incredibly exciting, you know, for the folks that have been following this project, for the folks that have been working on this project that we have a first sort of major,\r \r release\r \r of the project. And it's, you know, I think it's a a framework that we've seen,\r \r play out a few times, you know, in the data science ecosystem where\r \r a team will develop an amazing open source,\r \r framework or functionality. I think we've seen this,\r \r with the\r \r DBT\r \r package. If you're if you're, familiar with DBT software that I think allows you to do,\r \r more versionable\r \r ETL,\r \r They also have, I believe, a paid offering of that as well. I know that the team at Pymc sort of has some similar things\r \r going on, and it looks like the DuckDV team obviously has this incredibly powerful open source software that we can now use for\r \r doing some\r \r pretty incredibly efficient,\r \r ECL and and SQL querying\r \r on large datasets\r \r in,\r \r like, no time at all. But they've also built out, obviously, a, sort of privatized side of the business that allows them to to hopefully make money and to continue to,\r \r enhance DuckDV\r \r itself and that's this Mother Duck offering that we're talking about here. So there's pretty good documentation\r \r on,\r \r how to connect to your mother duck,\r \r service\r \r from Python but it looks like there's not necessarily any documentation\r \r out there yet on doing this in R.\r \r\n\nAlthough the author of this blog post, Novikha\r \r Nakhov,\r \r notes that it's it should be pretty straightforward to do so,\r \r if you follow sort of the the Python framework and just adopt it leveraging, you know, what we know about how to connect to DuckDV databases\r \r using r. So that's what, Novica is doing in this blog post. He is outlining how you would go about connecting to a mother duck instance\r \r from our,\r \r leveraging our 441,\r \r on Linux with DuckDB version 1.0.0.\r \r It's pretty easy to connect, to, you know, a DuckDb database and in memory database and he has a nice little code snippet of how to do this, how to populate that database using a data frame, and then how to query it using SQL syntax. And, it also notes that we do have the new duckplier package that would allow you to do this in a more dplyr like approach as opposed to having to write a sequel string in your db get query argument.\r \r But for the purposes of this blog post we're not going to explore\r \r Duckplier.\r \r\n\nSo I Novica\r \r details the Python approach first to connecting to to mother duck,\r \r and really it's pretty simple. And this Mother Duck Extension\r \r actually comes native to the Python duckdb package. And it's just a little one liner essentially that allows you to connect to your mother duck instance.\r \r You'll automatically get a notification in the terminal\r \r telling you what URL you should enter in your browser to be able to authenticate\r \r to your mother duck service,\r \r and then you're essentially good to go from there.\r \r In R, it's a little little trickier. The syntax looks pretty similar. It's a a one liner to try to connect to your your mother duck instance.\r \r\n\nBut one of the first things that you have to do is actually from the terminal, I think write a little bit of code,\r \r to create a local database that's called md or shorthand for for mother duck.\r \r So the reason that you have to do that at nova deposits is that, the duck dp package for r doesn't automatically figure out that it needs to load this additional mother duck extension the way the Python package does.\r \r So you have to sort of do that yourself\r \r but, again, Novica has all the code for us to do that here and it's it's fairly straight forward.\r \r You have to run a DB execute command to load this mother duck extension\r \r and then you're pretty much good from there, to be able to connect your mother duck instance and write your SQL queries that are going to execute in the cloud as opposed to\r \r locally.\r \r\n\nSo it's a a fairly, you know, straightforward blog post. It's really really helpful, I think, for those of us that are exploring DuckDB and want to try out Mother Duck. I will note that there's a free tier of the mother duck offering that gives you I think 10 gigabytes of storage,\r \r up to 10 compute unit hours per month which is probably a lot, you know. I'm not sure, you know, we know how fast DuckDV queries execute. That's right. Most of my DuckDV queries even on parquet files, you know, that are\r \r gigabyte, 1 or 2 gigabytes in size\r \r will run-in\r \r maybe a second or 2, and there's no credit card required for this free offering.\r \r\n\nSo there's no reason to not try out this mother duck service if it's something you're interested in. And if you need to go up to, the the paid tier, it's $25 a month per organization,\r \r I guess not per user, which is pretty incredible.\r \r If you're an organization that wants to leverage this mother duck service, that gives you a a 100 gigabytes of storage and a 100 compute unit hours per month, which I, you know, unless you're doing some pretty crazy stuff, I can't imagine that you would you would hit that. So I think it's a very sort of generous price point that we have here, and, obviously, it's amazing that we have this free tier that allows you to to try it out first, if you if you want to and and maybe that's all you need as well. So pretty incredible. Great walk through by NovaCon on how to use this in R because up until now, I don't think there's been any documentation\r \r on how to connect to, the mother duck service from our and it seems like there there was a little tricky hack that he pointed out. That's definitely going to help. Those of us who wanna try this out ourselves, probably save us a lot of hours. So we're very grateful that he went down that rabbit\r \r\n\n[00:25:57] \r Eric Nantz"

But, yeah, it's a similar syntax with what, Novica outlines here in this post. And, yeah, I guess, I'm interested in exploring mother duck to just see, you know, on a on a very basic basis just kinda how it plays in my workflows.\r \r One thing I'm immediately thinking of, Mike, is that if you're an organization\r \r or you're a smaller or big company and you wanna leverage\r \r DuckDV as your database back end for things like shiny apps or whatnot. It sure does seem like having that hosted in a data warehouse would be an intriguing idea to help offset some of that storage footprint from you\r \r to that to that vendor.

        "trans_text": "I'd be happy to, Eric. You know that I am,\r \r want to sing the praises of the parquet format\r \r and everything around it. So very excited about this Nano Parquet.\r \r Our package and the 0.3.0\r \r release,\r \r that Gabor worked on, I believe,\r \r Hadley may have worked on it as well and some others, on the the Tidyverse team\r \r at Posit.\r \r So one of the reasons that they created the Nano Parquet package is that, they wanted to be able to,\r \r you know, interop with Parquet files\r \r without necessarily\r \r needing,\r \r some of the the weight that comes along with like the arrow package because\r \r the arrow package does have a fair amount of dependencies on it and it can be a little heavy to install.\r \r\n\nSo one of the things about this nanoparquet package is that it has no package or system dependencies at all other than a c plus plus 11 compiler.\r \r It compiles in about 30 seconds into an R package that is less than a megabyte in size.\r \r It allows you to read multiple parquet files which is in a traditional sort of data lake,\r \r structure\r \r very very common,\r \r with a single function, you know, sort of like what we have in the reader package. I I don't know if this is little known or if it's well known but if you just point that to a directory\r \r instead of a file\r \r it will read in all of the files in that directory assuming that they have the same schema,\r \r and essentially append the data together into a big data frame. And that's the same thing that the nanoparquets\r \r readparquet\r \r function will do for us. It also supports writing most our data frames to, Parquet files\r \r and has a pretty solid set of type mapping rules between our data types\r \r and the data types that get embedded as metadata\r \r in a parquet file,\r \r which is, you know, again, another reason why,\r \r you know,\r \r parquet format exists and I think was another part of the motivation for this nano parquet\r \r package that it gets a little bit of a reputation, the parquet\r \r format, for only being for large datasets.\r \r\n\nLike, you only wanna use parquet file format when your your data is big.\r \r And, I think what Gabor is trying to argue here in this blog post and that I would agree with\r \r is that that's not necessarily,\r \r you know, the case. And I think that anyone can make a case for leveraging the parquet for file format for storing data of of any size. And one of the, I think, big reasons for that\r \r is,\r \r the, you know, ability to not only have the data in the file but also metadata\r \r around the data including the data types\r \r such that when you hand that parquet file off to to someone else, they don't have to in their code the the way we used to do when we read a CSV and and define what the data type for each column that's coming in. You don't have to do that because it's embedded in the file itself.\r \r So we have a lot more safety around,\r \r you know reading data frames and writing data frames and ensuring,\r \r portability,\r \r you know, not only between languages but between users essentially so that, you know, what you see is what you get.\r \r\n\nSo I I think that's really helpful. You know, we know that Parquet is performant and typically\r \r a smaller size\r \r than, you know, what you would store in a traditional delimited type of file,\r \r which is is helpful\r \r as well.\r \r And, you know, there's additional things like concurrency,\r \r a parquet file can be divided into to row groups so that parquet readers can can read, uncompress, and decode row groups in parallel parallel as Gabor points out.\r \r So just a lot of I think benefits\r \r for leveraging the parquet file format and I think this is maybe one of the first blogs that I've seen\r \r make the case for the parquet for file format for small data as opposed to big data. So I'm super excited about the nanoparquet,\r \r package because I think that there are some\r \r particular use cases, you know, potentially Shiny apps that I'm developing that are maybe reading a a smaller dataset where I don't necessarily need to,\r \r leverage the whole Arrow suite of tools and maybe I just need to to read that data set in, you know, one time,\r \r from a parquet file, and the nano parquet package might be all I need.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:34:23] \r Eric Nantz"

I think what Nanoparque is doing here, again, great for the small dataset,\r \r situation,\r \r but I really like these metadata functions that are put in here too because I think\r \r nano parquet could be a great tool\r \r for you, especially being new to parquet,\r \r getting to know the ins and outs of these files, knowing, like you said, the translation between the r object types and the parquet object types in the dataset. There are lots of handy\r \r handy functions here that maybe they are part of the arrow package. I just didn't realize it, but to be able to quickly have these simple functions that grab, say, the schema\r \r associated with parquet,\r \r grabbing the metadata\r \r directly in a very detailed printout\r \r of, you know, a nice tidy data frame of these different attributes. I think this is a great way\r \r to learn just what are the ins and outs of this really powerful\r \r file type. And, of course, Gabor is quick to mention\r \r some limitations\r \r for this. He does say he probably wouldn't recommend using this to write\r \r large parquet files because this has only been optimized for single threaded\r \r processing.\r \r\n\nBut with that in place, I still think this\r \r is an excellent way to kind of dive a little bit or really deep into what are the ins and outs of parquet. And then when you're ready for that transition,\r \r say, to a larger datasets,\r \r he obviously at at the conclusion of his post calls\r \r the Arrow project out as well as DuckDV out. So you've got it all it all leads somewhere. Right? You may your your situation may be that Nanoparquet is gonna fit your needs, and that's awesome. More power to you. And then as you escalate your data sizes, then you can still use par k. You're just maybe transitioning to a different package\r \r to import those in or the write those out. So\r \r I think it's it's a great introduction\r \r piece\r \r as well as\r \r I'll be honest. I'm putting on my life sciences hat for a second.\r \r\n\nI would absolutely love to use parquet format as opposed to a certain format that's in that ends in 7 b that.

However, like you said, we have multiple packages.\r \r They're not with DuckDV itself, not multiple packages that interact with parquet.\r \r You've got lots of choice here. And, yeah, the time is ripe as it does seem like we're we're moving on to, like, these newer newer formats, these newer database formats that the the sky is indeed the limit here.\r \r And, yeah, thanks for riding that ship. I was about to go on more rants about another format, but we're gonna keep it positive here because\r \r this issue has much more than just what we talked about here in the three highlights here. I had lots of fun looking at the new packages, the updated packages,\r \r and much more. So we'll take a couple of minutes for our additional fines here. And, yeah, going back to the, sports theme for a second,\r \r now that we have a lot of interesting tournaments going on right now in the world of soccer and football. You might wanna visualize some of those, you know, head to head matchups, and I've got the package just for you for that one. A new package called brackets\r \r offered by Vera and Limpopo, who you might familiar be familiar with. She's been a frequent contributor to the shiny community\r \r and many talks and presentations.\r \r\n\nBut brackets is an HTML widget that lets you very quickly\r \r visualize\r \r the bracket\r \r of a tournament.\r \r And I could see\r \r lots of use cases in the world of sports analytics for darn sure, but the ever fascinating part of this package is that it was actually built\r \r during a course that Virla teaches\r \r about supercharging\r \r your HTML widgets, which is part of the analytics,\r \r platform that she recently joined alongside David Grandgen.\r \r So they've been both,\r \r hard at work on some of these courses about Shiny\r \r and HTML widgets.\r \r And, yeah, Brackets is one of the products of those courses. But, yeah, when I get back to doing more sports analytics in the future, I think I'm gonna put Brackets in my Shiny app just for fun alone, but I could see lots of lots of cool utility with that.\r \r\n\n[00:40:20] \r Mike Thomas"

I did not realize that Virla is the one who put that together,\r \r and I'm excited to see more from that, especially,\r \r as we continue\r \r to dive deeper into a couple tournaments in my favorite sport, soccer or football for the rest of the world.\r \r A lot of bracketology\r \r going on these days so looking forward to more in that, area.\r \r One call out, that I wanna make is\r \r a Frank Harrell's blog, Statistical\r \r Thinking, has a new slide deck,\r \r that he gave as a presentation\r \r at the International Chinese\r \r Statistical Association Applied Statistics Symposium\r \r in Nashville,\r \r recently,\r \r and the talk is titled Ordinal State Transition Models as a Unifying Risk Prediction\r \r Framework,\r \r and he presents a a case for the use of discrete time mark of ordinal longitudinal\r \r state transition models.\r \r\n\nIf if we can pack all of those words into the same sentence and really the purpose there is is estimate estimating\r \r risk, and expected time in a given state,\r \r and and it's really, you know, in the vein of clinical trials in that area. But\r \r I took a look at these slide decks and,\r \r state transition matrices and models are something that I deal\r \r a ton with in, banking and financial services\r \r because most,\r \r loans\r \r banks have a particular rating assigned to that loan based upon, how risky it is to the bank, you know, the likelihood\r \r of that loan going bad, essentially, or likelihood of re repayment or or the borrower not repaying it. And, you know, they continue to to reevaluate\r \r that state that that loan is in.\r \r\n\nYou know, it could be monthly, it could be quarterly, it could be at some longitudinal\r \r time horizon. And then we want to take a look at how the volume within that loan portfolio shifted from one state to another,\r \r across a given time period.\r \r So I have in our package out there called migrate that is due for some updates,\r \r or due for a re release on crayon. We've had some work done on it recently but I just need to push it over the hump. So,\r \r I would check out these slides if you're interested in this type of stuff but mostly I'm calling, this\r \r slide deck out as a call to action for myself to get some work done on the migrate package\r \r and hold myself to it, out in the public here.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:42:57] \r Eric Nantz"

        "trans_text": "Yes. We're getting it out there. And, yeah, we we've been taking some mild inspiration from a certain team in Canada that's now dragged the uncertainty from Florida to game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals. So if they can come from a 3 hole deficit,\r \r we can knock out another podcast today, I dare say. I like that analogy. Yes.\r \r Yeah. It it works for me today anyway. So what also works is our weekly itself is a project where we have a rotating set of curators for every single week. And this week, it was curated by Ryo Nakagorua,\r \r another one of the OG's of the Arruki project itself.\r \r\n\nAnd as always, he had tremendous help from our fellow Arruki team members and contributors like all of you around the world with your awesome poll requests and\r \r certain suggestions.\r \r So we lead off with an issue that if you ever have released a package on CRAN,\r \r you are probably familiar with at one point or another.\r \r Whether it's your package or one that you depend on,\r \r is sometimes\r \r on the CRANS system, there are packages that may fail certain checks.\r \r Happens to all of us, and then there may be such a failure\r \r that the CRAN team says,\r \r okay. We've detected this, failure.\r \r\n\nNow, you have until a certain amount of time\r \r to fix this.\r \r And that can be scary for a lot of people, myself included, especially if it's a package that is a very important part to my workflow or is a dependency\r \r of an important part of my workflow.\r \r But you may want to know just at a glance\r \r what is really happening in this landscape.\r \r And this first highlight covers that and another bonus feature to boot that's come into R recently\r \r where Matt Dre, another frequent contributor to Rwicky highlights in the past,\r \r has created\r \r 2 very neat interfaces.\r \r\n\nAnd the first of which we're gonna talk about is this grand deadlines dashboard.\r \r This is very interesting, and the way this has been generated is that\r \r you may not know this, but in the base version of R, there is a handy function\r \r called crannpackagedb\r \r where this is literally grabbing\r \r an online source of data that the CRAN team maintains about package metadata.\r \r And you may be thinking to yourself, well, wait. Isn't this based on my current installation of r? No. No. No. This is a publicly\r \r available dataset that is updated regularly. Not quite sure the frequency of the updates,\r \r but there were 2 new fields that were introduced recently\r \r in this data frame. And in Matt's post, he shows first the typical metadata. You get, like, the package name, the version,\r \r and the maintainer,\r \r but there are 2\r \r additional columns. The first of which\r \r is called deadline,\r \r and deadline is giving, as the name suggests, the date\r \r that the CRAN team has given that package author or that package itself\r \r to fix whatever issues have been flagged\r \r in their check system.\r \r\n\nAnd you sure enough on the CRAN page, you could go to each package's website. You could then see\r \r the notes of these check failures on that package\r \r site itself on CRAN.\r \r But what Matt has done here is he took this opportunity to learn, become the latest and greatest in shiny development, which, of course, will please me in Mike's ears quite a bit. He has leveraged bslib\r \r and some pretty nifty ways of constructing the UI\r \r to create a very attractive looking,\r \r very fit for purpose deadline\r \r dashboard\r \r with individual\r \r cards as in the BSweb system\r \r that give\r \r at a high level the number of days remaining until that deadline, or,\r \r unfortunately, it could be the days that have passed since that deadline.\r \r\n\nAnd you can see that very nicely. You have color coded boxes here, so you could quickly\r \r grok in the order. It goes from the ones that have they're\r \r running the longest in their update up until the ones that have more time.\r \r But you could scroll through this and see very quickly then which packages have been flagged, and it'll give you a direct link\r \r to the detailed\r \r check failures that you can navigate to directly from this page.\r \r Really nifty interface here,\r \r and he's not alone in this. Actually, Hadley Wickham himself has also built a similar report, albeit it's built with what it looks like an automated portal kind of GitHub action\r \r deployment, but it's got similar metadata\r \r associated with it. So you got 2 great sources\r \r for this information.\r \r\n\nAnd I got wind of this not so much from Matt's post, but from a post he did on Mastodon as he was experimenting with this.\r \r And I pull up this interface, and I'm thinking to myself,\r \r oh, this is nifty. When I pulled up the interface,\r \r it was running on shiny apps. Io. It is a shiny app after all, but, immediately, in my head\r \r you wanna guess what was popping in my head, Mike, as I thought about what this could be good with?\r \r\n\n[00:05:55] \r Mike Thomas"

        "trans_text": "You got it. I'm on the the Shiny Live web train as you know from my\r \r recent efforts on the ER consortium pilot. So I wondered,\r \r I wonder what why maybe that wasn't done. Well, sure enough, it went to the GitHub repo, and I'd see that Matt did indeed attempt this,\r \r but it wasn't working.\r \r So this got me thinking here. You know what? I've been in the Shiny Live game for for a bit here with this other project.\r \r Maybe I could have my hand at trying\r \r to get to the bottom of this.\r \r Hence, my rabbit hole. So it's a little bonus,\r \r dev story time of Eric here. I pulled it up, cloned it on my local system, and I tried to look at the errors. And Matt did,\r \r have, like, a a general version of this error and an issue on his issue tracker on GitHub.\r \r\n\nAnd I noticed that for whatever reason, the shawnee live app could not download\r \r that aforementioned\r \r CRAN database from that handy function inside of r.\r \r Why is that?\r \r This gets really interesting because, apparently,\r \r there are\r \r security controls in place in your web browser\r \r for accessing certain versions of URLs\r \r behind the scenes\r \r due to what's called the cores or the cross origin\r \r something or another. I'm not as in-depth with this, but I have seen posts from George Stagg in the past on, like, the WebR\r \r issue repository or the Shiny Live issue, tracker repository\r \r saying that you have to be careful about how you download files. And in fact,\r \r in web web r, you have to use the download that file function more often than not to actually download something, and you have to hope that the browser is able to access that URL because of these built in security protocols.\r \r\n\nSo I noticed that even I tried to download the file directly after I scanned the source of this, CRAN package DB function,\r \r I still couldn't get that RDS file. It just would not register.\r \r Then I went down another rabbit hole to figure out, I wonder if others have experienced this with RDS files. I wonder if it was just specific to that or, you know, just shooting throwing darts at a dartboard at that point.\r \r I stumbled upon another issue on the WebR repo where somebody put up a clever workaround\r \r to use this kind of openly available\r \r domain, like, referral service\r \r where you can transform a URL to meet these core security requirements.\r \r\n\nIt's kinda like when you have in, certain, you know, web lingo,\r \r you can put in a base URL, and then one of the query parameters is like the URL that you're actually interested in.\r \r There is such a thing as this that I stumbled upon in the issue tracker, and I'll put a link to my poll request in the show notes where you can get the the full details of this.\r \r But it's so I I plugged in this kind of more modified URL,\r \r and sure enough,\r \r I could get the RDS file from the CRAN site once I made this modified URL. So I thought, okay. I'm in business now.\r \r So in the in the source code of Matt's dashboard here,\r \r I now have\r \r a handy function to detect\r \r if the app is running in a web assembly process. And that's credit to Winston Chang from the WebR repo\r \r to basically detect if we're in what's called the\r \r web and scripting\r \r kind of functionality and web assembly. Again, I'm still learning all this, but it's kinda like a a simple true false if you're in it or not. So then if I'm in it,\r \r I know to use this custom function that I developed to modify the URL\r \r with download that file directly and then import that into r as a typical RDS file. Whereas if you're running this in a traditional r process, you can use that function that Matt shows in the post as is. No no big deal there.\r \r\n\nAnd so\r \r so once I figured that out, I thought I'd solved everything then. But, no, there was one other kink here, Mike, and, you know, it never stops sometimes.\r \r WebR\r \r is currently still using our version 4 dot 3 dot 3.\r \r And Matt has,\r \r as he's actually covered, I believe, in one of his recent Mastodon posts, in version 4.4,\r \r now there is a handy function in BESAR that we've actually covered called sort underscore buy,\r \r where you can sort a day frame very quickly. It'll be very familiar to any of you that use the dply or arrange function.\r \r Well, guess what? In the web assembly version, that function doesn't exist because that's running 4 dot 3. So then I have another\r \r trick where if I'm running in web assembly mode, I use the more, you might call traditional\r \r order function in base r with the data frame referencing the variables\r \r directly.\r \r\n\nAgain, dusting off my, you\r \r might say, our development skills from pre 2015 on that, but, hey, Gradle was useful again. Right? So once you put both of those things in, then the web assembly version actually works.\r \r\n\n[00:11:06] \r Mike Thomas"

You might even be giving a little bit of a talk at Pawsit Conferences here on this exact topic. So it sounds like you were the best the best man for for the job, so to speak, on this one.

So I know he's grateful\r \r to you for that work that you put in and that pull request that I'm I'm taking a look at right now. It's it looks like it's full of rabbit holes that you went down.

So that that's that's fantastic.\r \r\n\nAnd the app is the app is great. It's really cool to see the the Shiny Live use case here. I know that that's something that Matt was trying to tackle here and was also trying to up skill a little bit on bslib.\r \r So the the app that came, out of it looks looks really nice. I think, you know,\r \r an alternate approach if you didn't care about, you know, going the the bslib route and the shiny live route would be you could potentially,\r \r have like a GitHub actions script, right, that would reach out to the the CRAN database that doesn't need, you know, Shiny Live or anything like that,\r \r you know, to be able to run and collect that data, maybe store it as an RDS file on a nightly basis that gets refreshed in the the repository\r \r\n\n[00:12:54] \r Eric Nantz"

What we're speaking about here\r \r is the very influential and very powerful\r \r Our Universe project,\r \r which just got a very, you know, welcome revamp to its user interface and user facing functionality.\r \r So this next highlight comes from a blog post from the architect of our universe himself, your own oombs, who talks about,\r \r guess what? The web interface for our universe has a brand new front end, and this is not\r \r not a trivial front end by any means.\r \r\n\nIt's actually based in\r \r the express JavaScript framework with some server side rendering that,\r \r Jerome says has been greatly helpful\r \r to getting results appearing on the our universe page much more quickly,\r \r much more efficiently.\r \r I even did a little,\r \r GitHub investigation\r \r last night in this repo, and it's even using mongodb\r \r as well of all things. My goodness. Talk about supercharging\r \r your UI and back end processing.\r \r But,\r \r obviously, this is an audio podcast. We can't really show you over in this little chapter marker. I've got a, image of it, but we'll describe kinda what he is most excited about in these updates. And what I saw when I scanned this earlier\r \r is that now this the UI of it, it's gonna be very much optimized\r \r to multiple, you know, resolutions wherever you're looking at this on, like, a a phone screen or on a big monitor. He's done a lot of attention to detail to make the page very responsive,\r \r which we all kinda take for granted now when we build our shiny apps with bsweb or other frameworks like that. And as I mentioned,\r \r server side processing for a lot of these rendering results. So your client browser\r \r isn't having to do as much of the heavy lifting as it's pulling this information from the our universe services.\r \r\n\nAnd he's also\r \r made a little bit of rearrangement\r \r to where you see the information on the owner\r \r going on the left sidebar now.\r \r And then, also,\r \r each package now gets a dedicated section to we just talked about earlier, citation information, which I'm sure the DOI,\r \r framer from CRAN may or may not play a role there.\r \r And also some handy\r \r contribution\r \r charts that are showing now proper time stamps\r \r and kinda capping out at 12 contributors in case you have a package that gets a boatload of contributors and not overwhelming\r \r the graph.

It all looks very\r \r cohesively\r \r constructed here.\r \r Really nice stuff. We invite you to check out the post\r \r for, obviously, links to the information.\r \r And he was very careful to keep backward compatibility\r \r here with the various URLs at different parts of our universe such as the\r \r packages,\r \r cards themselves, the articles.\r \r\n\nYou're gonna still get those same URLs. So don't fret if you're a package author on our universe. I'm wondering, oh, no. I passed this link to, like, my team or or in my, you know, Twitter or Mastodon,\r \r shout out to you. You'll still be able to use those same links. But, again,\r \r really, really polished interface here, and it just goes to show you that it seems like your own never stops on his our universe development adventures, but really really awesome UI enhancements here.\r \r\n\n[00:22:17] \r Mike Thomas"

You you know,\r \r when our universe originally came out that the UI to me that we now had\r \r around, you know, these individual package sites was like mind blowing that we had something like this now. Right? Instead of having to go to, I guess, GitHub and take a look at the the read me or or the package down site. Right? This our universe serves a lot more purposes than just that\r \r and\r \r thinking back to what the UI looks like before this facelift,\r \r this one no offense to the old UI but like because that blew me away, but this one has blown the other one away.\r \r So this is just much much cleaner. The navbar looks fantastic.\r \r\n\nIt looks like they have, you know, these different cards. Reminds me very much of like a bslib\r \r card type of situation that we have going on here that breaks out the section content with really nice headers as well as footers,\r \r which are are fantastic and and then it all the readmes,\r \r and the vignettes the way that they have rendered now I think everything is just a little bit cleaner which is fantastic.\r \r I'm looking at at one of my own for my package migrate and somehow,\r \r up here I have a link to my\r \r or Yaron has a link to my mastodon account next to my name. I'm not even sure I ever supplied that.\r \r I must have at one point in time because I imagine that he's not doing that by hand, but it's it's you have to see it for yourself and and take a look at the new Our Universe face lift, you know, search your favorite package,\r \r take a look at what the site looks like. I need to start installing packages from our universe. I need to to shift over there\r \r from some other package managers because I think there's a lot of advantages to this being sort of a one stop shop for,\r \r you you know, package installation in my local work, package installation for for web assembly\r \r purposes, right, as well. Yes.\r \r\n\nSo it's it's a pretty incredible resource that we have as as well as all the documentation,\r \r citation,\r \r you know, and all sorts different things that we have around all the different packages,\r \r that are now on\r \r the our universe.

But,\r \r yeah, I was even pulling up the I now have 2 packages on our universe, albeit they're both related to the,\r \r podcasting 2.0 ecosystem. But, boy, those pages look fantastic.\r \r Like, man, my goodness. I I I feel good about passing this off to somebody and showing it off to to friends and stuff. This this is top notch. I love it. Just love it. Me too.\r \r Sometimes, I'll catch myself\r \r saying when I read maybe some terse documentation.\r \r\n\nI'm not gonna say it's inspired by real life scenarios, but, you know, take that for what it's worth. And I'll kind of flippantly say to myself,\r \r who even wrote this stuff?\r \r Well, you know what? We're gonna answer that question literally in a much different context in our last highlight today\r \r because\r \r there is, of course, even in this advent of technology and most of us using a keyboard or a touch keyboard to write, you know, in the majority of our communication,\r \r there are still many instances where we are handwriting material.\r \r And there is a very important\r \r domain of research\r \r in forensics\r \r that are looking at more data driven approaches\r \r to helping identify\r \r potentially from a source of handwritten\r \r materials, maybe they're letters, maybe they're short notes, maybe they're whatever have you,\r \r I'm trying to use, you know, awesome algorithms\r \r to help link maybe certain\r \r writing sources to a particular author or a particular, you know, writer.\r \r\n\nThis last highlight\r \r is fascinating to me in a world that I definitely don't frequent in the world of forensics,\r \r but there is a major update to an r package\r \r called handwriter.\r \r This is maintained by Stephanie Reinders, and she is part of what I believe\r \r is the Iowa State University,\r \r the Center For Statistics and Application\r \r in Forensic Evidences or CSAE for short,\r \r mouthful, but they've been doing a lot of research in this space.\r \r And in particular, this r package that we're referencing here\r \r is a first step in a bigger pipeline that they are in the process of open sourcing, although they've got some manuscripts\r \r to show for it,\r \r where this package handwriter\r \r will take a PNG\r \r screen grab, if you will, of any handwritten content,\r \r and it's gonna apply\r \r some handy analysis\r \r methods\r \r to help identify\r \r certain features of this writing. And this is\r \r it's all about rabbit holes. I can only imagine how much research time is gonna spend into this, but I'll give a high level of the pipeline because there's no way we could do it all just this year, but it's got 4 major pieces of this pipeline.\r \r\n\nFirst of which is that let's say you\r \r are scanning a handwriting reference that has colored\r \r ink or whatnot.\r \r It's going to turn that image into literally great black and white or gray scale first, and then\r \r it's gonna take, you know, the the stroke width of each of the writing. And there's,\r \r we have a link in the show notes to the package site itself where they have a good example using literally the word c safe\r \r written in cursive\r \r where they will take this reducing the width of each of those strokes to 1 pixel.\r \r That's fascinating too.\r \r\n\nAnd then trying to detect,\r \r they call this the break phase next\r \r to compose it into small pieces, which in 2 of you might think are the individual letters\r \r in this writing.\r \r And they do this with a little graph theory to boot. They'll put nodes and edges\r \r that correspond to these different points in the in the detection of these units or breaks.\r \r And then they'll actually take measurements of the distances\r \r between these breaks,\r \r distances between the different letters\r \r to help figure out then, okay. Can we are there certain properties\r \r of this writing\r \r that then if they get additional sources, if they get similar writing style,\r \r you will see different versions of these or similar versions of these metrics\r \r as compared to, say, if you and I, Mike, wrote, like, the same, you know, same, like, short story on 1 page on a one piece of paper,\r \r it should detect our writing styles to be quite different. And I venture to say you probably have better handwriting than I do do because my handwriting's terrible. But, nonetheless,\r \r this package should be able to detect that if we gave 2 PNGs\r \r of our different sources that it would correctly\r \r identify us as being\r \r different riders.\r \r\n\nSo as I said, this is part of a larger,\r \r research pipeline that they also talk about\r \r in this, in this, package down site\r \r of how they integrate this\r \r with additional\r \r analytical tooling using some Bayesian methodology,\r \r some classical k means clustering\r \r to help really with a larger set of writing to be able to put this into distinct groups so that then you could link maybe potential\r \r sources to the same author.\r \r So as you can imagine, where this would really be important, especially in the world of forensics,\r \r is if there is an investigation and maybe one of the pieces of evidence\r \r is a writing that maybe a suspect had and then trying to link that maybe to that actual person as part of the evidence. I'm just speculating here because, again, not in my domain, but you could see how important this is in the role of forensics. So the fact that r itself\r \r is able to drive a significant part of this pipeline\r \r is absolutely fascinating to me. So when I pulled up this page the overnight,\r \r I I was I wasn't sure what to expect, but, boy, I can see that this is very important research.\r \r\n\nAnd, again,\r \r I I started to think it analyzing my handwriting because I'm not sure maybe I'd break the system on my bad handwriting.\r \r But nonetheless,\r \r this is, a pretty fascinating domain\r \r and certainly a big credit to that team,\r \r at CICE for really,\r \r putting all this out there. And if you're interested in this space, yeah, I would definitely recommend checking out the handwriter package.\r \r\n\n[00:31:19] \r Mike Thomas"

And like you, Eric, this is a domain that I literally know nothing about. Probably my extent of learning anything about handwriting\r \r processing in R is the old MNIST dataset,\r \r where you're trying to classify, figure out which number someone wrote down. You have this 60,000 row dataset of all the\r \r that you you might use. So if you have done that before and taken a look at m MNIST, this is gonna blow your socks off, especially if you are in the space of doing any sort of image processing or handwriting analysis\r \r or or stuff like that. There's a great and maybe we can link to it in the show notes, The the documentation\r \r here is fantastic\r \r and it's all in a GitHub repository\r \r as well. It is a GitHub Pages site which is fantastic\r \r and it is, you know, well beyond\r \r any package downside, let's put it put it that way, that I have ever created.\r \r\n\nSo it's it's absolutely beautiful.\r \r I'm not even sure that they're necessarily\r \r using PackageDown. I know they've got some CSS, some custom\r \r CSS going on and things like that in a docs folder just sort of in the main\r \r branch,\r \r but it's it's an absolutely beautiful\r \r really informative\r \r site. It is a fantastic example of\r \r really, you know, including as as much documentation as there is functionality and and covering\r \r all your bases. There is a how to guide which I would\r \r recommend\r \r being maybe one of the first places that you can take a look at the functionality of this package, you know, in terms of\r \r word and then just a few quick functions to be able to process that image and and take a look at the results And the depth of the analysis that, you know, techniques that are encapsulated in this package is incredible. As you mentioned, Eric, it's, you know, plotting all sorts of different vectors and and directions as well as, you know, going all the way into to Bayesian analysis too, I think is included in this package. I saw some commits that that have stuff to do with Python support as well.\r \r\n\nThere's all sorts of documentation in here for\r \r whether you're working on a Windows, additional information for Mac users as well. So it's it's a fantastic resource. Again, it really warms my heart to see a university\r \r adopting R this hard and really putting a ton of best practices\r \r And\r \r\n\n[00:35:03] \r Eric Nantz"

        "trans_text": "So it's story time with Eric now. So let's, buckle up for a few minutes here. So\r \r Friday night, I get a little opportunity to do a little, you know, open source development work on some of this podcasting database stuff. I've been pitching in with a podcasting 2 point o project. And recently,\r \r Dave Jones, who helps spearheads a lot of that effort, gave me access to some more\r \r lower level JSON files and object storage to help\r \r analyze some of the the data that's going into their database as kind of a more real time access of it. And these are these are actually massive JSON files. In fact, one of them is over 200 gigs worth. So\r \r I figured, okay. You know what? To help, you know, minimize the bandwidth cost just for once, I'm gonna download\r \r a snapshot of those locally\r \r on my, you know, somewhat beefy\r \r network storage down in the basement where I have, like, a group of 4 hard drives networked together, and that's where I do\r \r all my backup. So I figured, you know what? I'm just gonna throw it on there. That way, I can, you know, work with them in a prototyping way like any good citizen would do with bandwidth and everything like that.\r \r\n\nSo that was like, earlier in the week, and then Friday night rolls around. I'm gonna do a little hacking on it again, just kinda get to know those files a bit.\r \r Go to the path.\r \r My, laptop mounts. This is like a Samba share. But I I go to and it's run Linux, but Samba is the protocol. So in any event, I go to grab one of these files or always read it into R. It's kind of like a prototyping.\r \r And then I get a\r \r path file not found. And I'm thinking,\r \r what's this about?\r \r I know I downloaded earlier in the week, and it's alongside a bunch of my other kinda our open source, like big file stuff. And\r \r I go into the SSH\r \r session to my network storage that's running Linux. And\r \r I navigate to that area,\r \r directory not found.\r \r\n\nOh, no. Oh, boy.\r \r So I do a little poking around, and I realize\r \r that's not the only thing that I found.\r \r I am now not able to see some very, and I mean very important family media files, which if you guess\r \r are pictures and videos that I've recorded over the years.\r \r No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Now now I when I set this up many years ago, I did put in a couple backup strategies,\r \r one of which was to send my pictures\r \r over to\r \r Google Drive, albeit in an encrypted way\r \r so that I didn't feel like I was feeding their machine learning algorithms for image recognition\r \r and whatnot.\r \r\n\nAnd so I quickly dust off my notes on how to interact with that. I was using a service called Duplicate\r \r to get that.\r \r And luckily enough, I did get the majority of my pictures back, albeit\r \r they stopped working after 2023,\r \r which was odd because I didn't get an alert on that. So that's one downside. But what was not on that cloud backup\r \r were the videos.\r \r So\r \r back to this internal setup, I have what's called a\r \r pooled file system of all these drives put together.\r \r And then there was an weekly job I would run\r \r that was kinda like RAID. If you ever heard of, like, how network drives are backed up in, like, a mirrored way, RAID is one way to do it. This is a different take called SnapRAID\r \r where it would, every week,\r \r funnel everything into what's called a parity drive.\r \r\n\nAnd that way, if the worst happened,\r \r I could restore from that parity drive and get everything back. So I figured,\r \r oh, yes. I I did run that job. Right? Now I go to where that file would be stored. It's like this big compressed file.\r \r But then my heart sank because the last run of that, apparently, was in 2020,\r \r and I didn't know that.\r \r I still ran the restore anyway just to see what happens. And sure enough, I've got videos and pictures and other important files\r \r up to that point.\r \r So I am missing now\r \r 3 almost 4 years' worth of important content. So,\r \r of course, now I investigate,\r \r can I mount this drive somewhere else?\r \r\n\nCan I just take it out of this network storage and put it into, like, an enclosure,\r \r connect it to my laptop, see if I can somehow salvage the files from there?\r \r That's when I realized there's the problem. The hard drive is making this sequential kind of buzzing kind of sound\r \r and cannot be recognized by any OS.\r \r That screams\r \r hardware failure.\r \r So I have now sent this\r \r to a drive recovery vendor. I'm waiting to hear back for the evaluation if they can get everything back. But if they are able to get it back, I hate to say it's not gonna\r \r be cheap to get it back. But this is a very harsh lesson,\r \r folks. If you have a backup strategy, make sure to check that it's actually working.\r \r\n\nIf you learn nothing else from this 5 minute diatribe,\r \r look at your backup strategy. Make as many notes as you can because future self will need it when you absolutely positively least expect it like little old me here.\r \r\n\n[00:06:55] \r Mike Thomas"

I am sorry to hear that. I hope that that hardware vendor can can help you out some way somehow and it's not super expensive but, yes, that is, I think something we all struggle with is is backing up and and storage of especially, like, family media and stuff like that. I don't have a good strategy for it.\r \r Yeah. Oh, that that hurts my heart. That hurts my heart because I know how much work you've invested into\r \r building out, you know, your your hardware and software\r \r infrastructure in in the best ways possible and using the the best practices.

Of all the drives to fail,\r \r the one that has a majority of these family files, files, that had to be the one. I've got other nonsense on there that I could live without. It's just out of convenience, but it had to be that one. So\r \r on top of, yeah, this vendor crossing my fingers, I will not say who they are because I'm not sure if it's gonna work or not. So I'm not giving any free advertising here. I hope this vendor actually pulls it off. But the other lesson is\r \r I was kinda living on borrowed time with some of the infrastructure around this. So I am building\r \r as we speak. The parts are coming in the next couple weeks. A brand new server that's gonna have a much better strategy around it. So there you go. That'll be some rabbit holes.\r \r\n\nI does not surprise me at all. Best of luck with that. Yes. Thank you, sir. And, you know, one way or another, I'll I'll, share my learnings.\r \r They're they're this machine will double purpose. It will not just be a storage piece. This may be a piece where I can do\r \r some local Weaver machine learning stuff, AI stuff, or whatnot because I'm gonna I'm gonna spec it out pretty well for those workflows and media production. So it'll be a fun journey nonetheless. Just not one I was quite ready to do until Sure. This, certain event. Well, once you, install the Microsoft operating system and and turn the the Microsoft recall\r \r switch on, you'll never have to, you'll never have to worry about backing up anything ever again because it'll just watch you all the time. You know what? Yeah. What better peace of mind than to send that over to whatever they're training on? Oh, my goodness. For those of you who aren't aware of what we're talking about, that, Microsoft kinda got in a bit of a kerfuffle when they announced this\r \r feature, if you wanna call it that, where they would have\r \r a background process on your win Windows installation\r \r literally every, what, I don't know, 30 seconds.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:10:02] \r Mike Thomas"

Thank goodness.\r \r And they have been curated this week by Tony Elharbor, another one of our awesome,\r \r curators on the rweekly team. He's been around for quite a couple of years now. And as always, he had tremendous help from our fellow rweekly team members\r \r and contributors like all of you around the world with your awesome poll requests and suggestions.\r \r\n\nAnd we lead off the show with really a testament\r \r and a glimpse into\r \r the vast variety that's available to us with the nature of open source\r \r and especially some of the fundamental issues that can occur,\r \r not just from a development perspective,\r \r but also from a social and other type perspective as well.\r \r And this blog post and our first highlight comes from Kelly Baldwin,\r \r who is a assistant professor of statistics at Cal PIE,\r \r That is California Polytechnic\r \r State University for those that are outside of the US and may not know where that is. But in any event, she leads off with framing this discussion\r \r on 2 paths, if you might say, in the R community with respect to\r \r a lot of the ways that we handle data manipulation,\r \r data processing,\r \r and what has been perceived to be\r \r these separate roads traveled, so to speak. So she frames this post\r \r in light of Robert Frost, the road west traveled\r \r story.\r \r\n\nAnd she also is upfront that this definitely has some opinions. Hey, Mike and our full opinions on this show too. But\r \r I, as we go through this, I definitely see exactly where she's coming from, and I think it's definitely an important discussion\r \r to have.\r \r What we're talking about here are 2 major frameworks\r \r that have kind of, over time,\r \r become pretty mainstream in terms of the art community's efforts for data manipulation.\r \r 1 is the tidy verse, which is well known by this point.\r \r Of course, the development of the tidy verse has been led by Hadley Wickham\r \r and his team of engineers at Posit.\r \r\n\nAnd then we have data dot table.\r \r Data dot table was around well before the tidy verse. Data dot table,\r \r for those that aren't aware, had its first major release in 2008.\r \r Yeah. That's, got a dozen in the history books on this,\r \r And it was originally released by the core developer, Matt Dowell.\r \r And there's a link in the county's post for a nice video of what inspired they are dot table\r \r in the first place.\r \r And it you know, from near the beginning, they do that table has been so influential\r \r for many\r \r in the industry and academia,\r \r all walks of the life, so to speak, in the r community\r \r for respect to its very great performance and importing large data files.\r \r\n\nIt's got its own, you might call, DSL or domain specific language for how you conduct queries and whatnot\r \r and how you do, like, group summaries or filtering\r \r or creating new variables.\r \r It's got a syntax that is unique to it. And once you learn the ins and outs of it, it can be\r \r extremely powerful.\r \r And then fast forward about 6 years later,\r \r dplyr,\r \r the one of the cornerstones\r \r of what became the tidy verse, was released in 2014,\r \r again, authored by Hadley Wickham. And this, a lot of people point to this as the start\r \r of the tidy verse because of this new,\r \r at least new to many people at the time,\r \r way of performing these, you know, fit for purpose functions that use the data frame as, like, the main input\r \r such that you could combine this with the Magritter pipe and do all these nice kind of flowing\r \r analyses of data manipulation,\r \r you know, new variables, summarizations,\r \r group processing,\r \r and whatnot.\r \r\n\nSo with this, you now have, you know,\r \r at at this is Kelly Podsits here, about 3 major choices\r \r for your data processing.\r \r You could stick with base r. Of course, base r, it's got, you know, plenty of ways to do these type of summaries,\r \r data dot table,\r \r and dplyr.\r \r And they're all going to look quite different from each other.\r \r There has been a bit of a misconception\r \r over the years\r \r that data dot table is\r \r almost directly linked to base are. That's not quite the\r \r perception over the years that it was so\r \r perception over the years\r \r that it was so tightly coupled with base are that it was somehow going hand in hand with that. No. No. No. That's that's definitely not the case. It's got its own, you know, framework. It's got its own syntax. It's got its own paradigms.\r \r\n\nAnd again,\r \r in my opinion,\r \r choice is great in this pay in this space. Now, sometimes the kinds of choices, well, which one do I go with? Well,\r \r we're not going to always use a cliche, it depends, but a lot of it does actually depend\r \r on what you want out of your data processing pipeline.\r \r But this shouldn't be a situation where you feel like you have to pick 1 and stick with it forever.\r \r Just like any project, you should have the ability to choose the right framework for your requirements or for your job, so to speak,\r \r and what's important to you.\r \r\n\nBut\r \r it's one she also talks in this post is that,\r \r yeah,\r \r sometimes people feel like they have to be loyal\r \r to a certain package through and through no matter what. No. We all greatly respect developers, but in the end, the choice is ours for what we choose in our data processing needs in this case.\r \r And you shouldn't feel bad about going from, like, a little bit of base r to, like, data dot table or maybe the tidy verse and kinda\r \r as you wish to be able to mix these together. You're not confined\r \r to one framework or the other all the time. This is entirely driven by choice here.\r \r And so she recommends that let's be pragmatic\r \r about this. Let's not try to get into these,\r \r you know, you might call camps or tribalism\r \r of having to really be gung ho about one framework and you're gonna fit this, you know, use this hammer on every job, so to speak, no matter what. Let's be pragmatic about it.\r \r\n\nBut then she gets to the rest of the the next part of the post where she talks about kind of what's the reason that this is coming about, that she wants to, you know, put this out in the universe, so to speak.\r \r Well, in 2018, Mike, there was a certain event on our well, at the time was one of the leading spaces for kind of social type discussions in the art community on Twitter back when it was called Twitter.\r \r There was what she calls the great Twitter war of 2018,\r \r and take that for whatever irony you wanna read with that. But, Mike, just what in the heck for those that weren't around? What was this all about here?\r \r\n\n[00:18:17] \r Mike Thomas"

There were some,\r \r accounts\r \r on on Twitter and some folks that I guess\r \r decided to for whatever reason at that point in time get get fired up about whether or not you should be using data dot table or dplyr.\r \r It actually led as as Kelly, I believe, points out, to\r \r some positive conversations,\r \r between some of the the cooler heads and actually maybe the the more important folks on both sides of the fence including Matt Dowell and Hadley Wickham, I believe to the,\r \r development\r \r of the dtplyr\r \r package which is sort of the best of both worlds where you're allowed to write dplyr syntax that actually translates and executes\r \r data dot table code under the hood. So you you get your dplyr syntax, but you get your data dot table performance, which was was pretty cool.

From a project to to project basis,\r \r data dot table may make more sense for your project in one project and then the next one that you go to tidyverse may make a whole lot more sense to use and that is\r \r okay.\r \r\n\nEveryone listen.

So,\r \r in my opinion, you know, this is a great reflection.\r \r Very happy to hear that, there's been some grant funding towards the data dot table project that's going to allow that open source project to progress. That's something that we don't see a lot of the time where open source developers and community actually get get funding for their work and and for all the hard work that has gone into this project because,\r \r you know, if you take a look at the history of data dot table and what we're going on going on 15\r \r year or yeah. Something like that. Right? Going on 15, 16 years of the data dot table project.\r \r\n\nThere's been an incredible amount of work that has has gone into it and helped it evolve and get to the place it is\r \r now.

So I have a talk about\r \r these themes. And\r \r what's interesting here is, as you mentioned, there is funding for this recent effort\r \r and, well, through, you know, a a coincidental,\r \r situation. I was able to hear more from Kelly herself in a recent\r \r meeting, but this funding is coming from a National Science Foundation\r \r grant,\r \r that was carried out, I believe, ill, back in 2023.\r \r In fact, we may have covered parts of this in our weekly highlights way back when the launch of what they call the data dot table\r \r Ecosystem Project.\r \r\n\nAnd this is being headed by Toby Hocking as well as Kelly's involved with this as well. We'll have a link to this in the supplements of the show notes here.\r \r But this is meant to not just look at data dot table from literally just the source code perspective, but to help fund\r \r the ecosystem\r \r around it, which is both technical and\r \r infrastructure\r \r and social and making sure\r \r that it is sustainable\r \r for the long term.\r \r Certainly, Kelly is gonna be speaking about these themes in her upcoming talks,\r \r but there is one huge difference. And when you look at the history of data dot table as opposed to the history of tidyverse,\r \r is\r \r that let's be real here.\r \r\n\nWho's funding the tidyverse? It is a dedicated vendor,\r \r ieposit,\r \r helping to pay engineers full time, open source engineers to work on this.\r \r Data. Table does not have that. It is enthusiastic\r \r But like many projects in open source, it is built on the community to help drive that innovation,\r \r drive that continued development.\r \r So I know part of the motivation of this grant is to help make sure that that ethos\r \r is sustainable for such an important piece\r \r of many, and I do mean many in the community that rely on data dot table\r \r for all sorts of uses. I mean, I just spoke of a couple of them, but I always scratch the surface.\r \r\n\nAnd I've had, like I said, great success with certain pieces of it in my workflows, and I don't feel ashamed about that.

        "trans_text": "Well, we're gonna go back to the development side, Mike, a little bit because our next post is gonna talk about ways that you can at least\r \r help future you even more\r \r even when you're already buying into proper version control.\r \r And what we're talking about here is a latest post from Al Salmon who, of course, has been a frequent contributor to our weekly both as a curator and now contributor\r \r to many great highlights in this podcast.\r \r And she\r \r speaks about why you should invest in\r \r not just doing version control,\r \r but helping\r \r future you by making what she calls small and informative\r \r get commits.\r \r\n\nBecause\r \r I don't know about you, Mike, especially\r \r even now, sometimes\r \r when I'm in a tight bind and I realize, oh my goodness, I have about 10 files that\r \r I've gotta get committed now because the time's running out.\r \r I, I've I fall to temptation,\r \r hit all the checkboxes,\r \r hit stage, just say, get this a prod in my commit and be done with it.\r \r Yes. It still happens.\r \r Yes. I know better. And that's why this post is gonna help you figure out why what I did was such a big mistake.\r \r Because let's say you get to a point in time and you're either doing a code review, maybe a colleague's doing a code review for for example,\r \r and they see a line in your code.\r \r\n\nAnd they're thinking, well, Eric, why did you do that? Like, what was the motivation for that line?\r \r You don't have a comment around it because at the time, you're just trying to fix maybe fix an issue or something in your head, and then you didn't put it into prosperity and via commit or a comment.\r \r Well, of course, we get you can go back and look at the history of your commits. Right?\r \r And in fact, there is a concept\r \r in Git. They call it Git blame, but I I'm with my I'll hear. I hate that terminology.\r \r It's really not blaming anybody,\r \r but it's better to be called git explain. I like the way she phrases that because then in a platform such as GitHub,\r \r you could have the view of the code itself, I. E, the file, but then next to it, see which commit message related to that change.\r \r\n\nAnd you might see in that example that I gave that this mysterious line\r \r was part of like this massive 10 file commit and you just have something that says,\r \r get the prod or just get it done, get out of my hair or whatever you wanna call it.\r \r Well,\r \r that's not gonna help very much. But had you done small\r \r informative commit messages where you do, like, one file at a time or maybe a set of related changes even if they're spread across multiple files.\r \r That get blame methodology can be very helpful for you to go back in time and figure out what were you trying to fix. Were you trying to add a new feature? What was the motivation for that? A bit of like a a way to get a lens into your development journey\r \r of what happened there.\r \r\n\nSo, again, if you do what I said was a bad thing to do and just put all these files in one big commit, you're not gonna get any real benefit out of that.\r \r But like I said, had you done a small\r \r informative message\r \r of that particular change, and again, it might be one file, it might be related files,\r \r it's gonna make it so much easier for both you and collaborators\r \r to figure out just what was your motivation for that.\r \r So that's one reason to do it. But there is another reason,\r \r especially if you realize\r \r that over time, maybe it's only like a month later, maybe it's a long time later,\r \r Something\r \r is not working, and you've got to figure out just where\r \r it started to not work.\r \r\n\nThat's where Mike Sheehyah takes us onto another concept and get that I don't do enough of, but I can definitely say if you're behind on certain situations. Why don't you take us through that? Yeah. So my Elle talks about this tool that I admittedly\r \r\n\n[00:29:42] \r Mike Thomas"

        "trans_text": "do not use, this this function I guess you might call it that get offers us\r \r called git bisect.\r \r And what git bisect allows you to do is to try to identify the particular commit in history\r \r where your software was was working.\r \r And it it'll make you try some commits to help pinpoint, you know, which commit exactly\r \r introduced the bug that you're now\r \r observing and it sort of breaks your code,\r \r into 2 sections sort of before,\r \r everything was working\r \r and then after sort of everything\r \r fell apart.\r \r And it will assume that all commits are up to that particular commit that you're bisecting on were good, and it's gonna make you sort of explore,\r \r commit by commit the the the following\r \r ones to to figure out exactly,\r \r what introduced the breaking change. And it's\r \r it's a really nice feature that sort of allows us to I don't know. It almost feels like the debugger in a way in in R where you're able to sort of go commit by commit very slowly and figure out exactly which one is the one that introduced that that breaking change. And and hopefully,\r \r if you made small commits,\r \r we're able to identify\r \r that git commit that that broke things as, you know, this small diff that that in Mel's example shows, you know, 2 changed files with 3 additions and 2 deletions.\r \r\n\nIf we're very unlucky,\r \r it's going to have a message like one of those that Eric writes occasionally and I have never certainly ever ever written a commit like that that says, you know, commit a bunch of files and it's at, you know, 6 o'clock on a Friday\r \r and the the diff shows a 145 change files with 2,600\r \r editions and 22100 deletions.\r \r We we certainly hope that's not the case but but maybe it is. But GetBisect\r \r can help you get to that point.\r \r You know, one nice additional thing that we have,\r \r in our ecosystem\r \r now\r \r is is both unit testing and and services like GitHub Actions and and formerly Travis to when you do make a new commit,\r \r you can test, you know, you can execute your unit test to make sure that everything continues to work, after that new commit has been introduced and and this is certainly something that I I think everybody\r \r that uses Git can be guilty of is is not making small enough commits. I have sort of this long standing issue where\r \r I know that I need to make multiple changes to the same file,\r \r and I will make the first change and forget to just sort of commit that small change and I will make 3 different like conceptual changes within the same file.\r \r\n\nAnd now I either am at the mercy of,\r \r you know, trying to undo those\r \r particular,\r \r you know, changes number 23\r \r and just revert back to to change 1 and and make my commit message\r \r small and and related to that. Or try to write some 3 part commit message,\r \r that, you know, sort of tries to explain that the 3 different changes that took place but it's it's not good in either way is is really ideal or easy. So the best thing that I could possibly do is to stop after I make that first change to the file,\r \r make my commit, and move on to the second change. But but sometimes, you know, when you're in the zone,\r \r it's hard. It's hard to stop and and lift your fingers up off the keyboard and and remember to do that instead of just knocking everything out at the same time. But\r \r Git blame is and it should be called Git explain. I agree as well. I think it's a fantastic tool when we do have to go back and,\r \r you know, try to figure out sort of sort of what went wrong,\r \r what is the the status\r \r of, our our software at the point in time that that things went wrong, what what does our repository look like, and how can we sort of pinpoint\r \r where things went wrong and and what led to that. I think GitLab is a fantastic tool. I admittedly don't use it enough, but I do know the people that do use it and rave about it,\r \r and find it very helpful to their workflows. So it's it's one that I think my Elle is,\r \r inspiring me to\r \r dive a little bit deeper into and to start using a little bit more. So I I certainly appreciate\r \r the overview here. I I appreciate,\r \r the introduction and to get bisect as well because I think that that is gonna be a new handy tool that I'll be able to use in these, you know, tricky,\r \r situations where where something breaks and it's not trivial to pinpoint\r \r where it took place.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:34:19] \r Eric Nantz"

        "trans_text": "I'm rounding out our highlights today,\r \r at the risk of dating myself with a reference\r \r here. I feel the need for something, Mike. You know what I feel the need of? The need for speed\r \r because it doesn't just apply to one aspect of data processing. It also applies\r \r to the way we consume\r \r data coming from these robust APIs\r \r and combining that with the\r \r very vast evolving\r \r ecosystem\r \r of geospatial\r \r data and performance.\r \r Our next highlight has the intersection of all these and definitely made me do a few double takes in terms of the metrics that we're about to talk about here. In particular, we're talking about this post that comes from Josiah Perry who has been a long time member of the r community, and his tagline lately\r \r is helping\r \r r be built and used better in production.\r \r\n\nAnd his blog post here is his journey on making what he calls a ridiculously\r \r fast API client in r.\r \r And his day job is working for a company called called Esris, who is specializing in putting on these certain services\r \r to query geospatial\r \r data from many different development frameworks. I believe they have some host of services as\r \r well. Well, as I'm guessing as part of his daytime responsibilities,\r \r Josiah has released a new r package\r \r called arc\r \r just geocode,\r \r all one word, the big name here, which is an r binding and our interface\r \r to what they call the ArcGIS world decoder service.\r \r\n\nAnd he says that this looks like an official\r \r package from his organization,\r \r Esri,\r \r in this space.\r \r And in his knowledge, up to this point, he's got some metrics to prove it. He claims that this is the fastest geocoding library available in the entire\r \r our ecosystem.\r \r In fact,\r \r he's claims that our just geocode\r \r is about 17 times faster\r \r when you do what's called a single address geocoding\r \r and almost 40 times faster\r \r when doing a reverse geocoding\r \r lookup as compared to other packages\r \r in the community already in this space.\r \r So let's dive into this a bit more.\r \r\n\nHis first reason for why this is important\r \r is that some I took for granted until a recent project, I talked about the onset with some of this podcast metadata JSON data\r \r is that parsing JSON data\r \r is not always fast, my friend. Not always.\r \r Many of us are using JSON Lite, the, you know, almost tried and true package offered by your own ooms for,\r \r consuming and writing JSON data in r.\r \r And it's it's it's been a huge help to me. Don't get me wrong.\r \r But it does have some performance issues, especially when dealing with long text strings in your JSON data and then bringing that conversion back to an r object\r \r and the other way around.\r \r\n\nWell, guess what? Another language that starts of r comes at a rescue in in Josiah's initiative\r \r because there is a rust crate, that's kind of their term for packages,\r \r called SERDAY or SERD, I'm not sure if I'm saying it right, that handles both the serialization\r \r and deserialization\r \r of structures and rust.\r \r And guess what? It is very tailor made to JSON data too. It just expects you\r \r at the onset\r \r to help specify\r \r for your given JSON type data you want inside your your session,\r \r the specific\r \r attributes of each variable or each field.\r \r So in his example, he's got an address structure, if you call it, with all the different fields that would come out of this JSON data.\r \r\n\nAnd most of them, big surprise, are strings,\r \r but it'll give you the ability and rust to really determine what's supposed to be a string, what's supposed to be an integer,\r \r different types of integers. You can go, you know, really specific on all these needs.\r \r Now that's great and all, but how does that help with r?\r \r Well, there is the package called extender,\r \r which is kinda like the RCPP, if you will, of Rust to r.\r \r We'll let you tap into a Rust crate\r \r and bring that into r and be able to go back and forth with our functions to basically call out to these lower level Rust parts of the paradigm.\r \r So this,\r \r Serde JSON crate\r \r is a massive speed improvement in general for importing JSON data, serializing JSON data\r \r over the community counterparts as he attests to in this post.\r \r\n\nBut that's not the only part. The other part\r \r is a feature that I should have known about in my research in HDR 2, but it just went over my head until this post,\r \r is that\r \r we often use HDR, HDR 2, and this is the regeneration of that, if you will, by Hadley Wickham\r \r to help in r\r \r perform these, you know, requests to API\r \r services. I get request, post request, and whatnot.\r \r And, usually, I do these requests kind of 1 at a time, if you will. Like, there's a get request. I'm gonna do that with specific set of config parameters,\r \r bring it back down and whatnot.\r \r\n\nWell, how in the world did I not know about this function, Mike?\r \r Rec perform\r \r parallel,\r \r\n\n[00:46:29] \r Mike Thomas"

        "trans_text": "which lets you do it in more than one time. Oh my gosh. Where have I been, Mike? Did you know about this? Neither did I, Eric. I had no idea that this was part of the h t t r two package now, that we have the ability\r \r to send, I guess, paralyzed\r \r request to an API pretty easily and maybe point that function towards\r \r a connection pool or a few different nodes, few different workers,\r \r to be handling requests concurrently. This makes me think of, I don't know, potential integration with the crew package or something like that.\r \r Perhaps this is something that you could do on your your own machine and and leverage,\r \r you know, the the ability to parallelize your own machine\r \r and and send out a few different requests, at the same time which is is pretty incredible.\r \r\n\nAnd\r \r there's this Twitter thread that Josiah puts, earlier on in the blog post where he's, you know, he's he's showing off the fact that he was able to geocode,\r \r 2.6\r \r 1,000 addresses in in 3 and a half seconds. And and somebody asked, in as a reply\r \r to that particular screenshot that he put up, they said, isn't geocoding always bottlenecks by the server?\r \r And, that is true. But I guess when you have multiple servers to span the job across and we have this beautiful function request perform parallel that I imagine brings it all back together\r \r at the end.\r \r\n\nThat's that's a fantastic utility to be able to, you know, speed up,\r \r significantly and and this is something that I've dealt with in the past as well, geocoding.\r \r It takes time because you're typically going address by address and, you know, a lot of projects you'll you'll want to be geocoding your entire data frame which could get, you know, could get particularly long you know thousands tens of thousands\r \r hundreds of thousands of observations\r \r that you need to geocode\r \r so it's\r \r really interesting to me that we have the ability, you know, not only to leverage the speed of Rust,\r \r for this serializing\r \r and deserializing\r \r of JSON objects which is time intensive, but also,\r \r being able to just break the job out into across a few different,\r \r nodes here which is\r \r is pretty incredible, something that I didn't know about. Obviously, Josiah says that you need to be a little bit careful when you are doing anything like this especially when you're sending sort of paralyzed paralyzed\r \r requests\r \r at a different service that you don't perform,\r \r an accidental\r \r denial of service attack, you know, which is where you you make way too many requests all at once\r \r to the service\r \r and bring that down. So you don't wanna be the person that does that. So so certainly be be careful\r \r and perhaps, you know, use a small number of workers.\r \r\n\nIf you're just geocoding a couple thousand addresses, you don't need to spin up\r \r a few hundred workers or something like that to be able to do that just just\r \r spin up a couple and\r \r and maybe wait those extra few seconds that it's going to take, to be patient between, you know, spinning up a few workers and\r \r and many many workers. But it's really interesting because you will get, you know, these this great sort of orders of magnitude returns in performance,\r \r when you do\r \r add compute to the problem here as well as, you know, leveraging Rust for that that quick deserialization,\r \r of of JSON data. One thing that I will also shout out just because I was curious about this and, you know, we're\r \r finding all of\r \r these new, faster\r \r programming,\r \r software utilities out there when it comes to to data.\r \r\n\nAnd there is a DuckDb extension as well for handling\r \r JSON data and reading JSON data and so I would be interested\r \r to see how that compares to what Rust can do for parsing JSON data as well.\r \r\n\n[00:50:16] \r Eric Nantz"

I'm experimenting that a little bit too actually in my DuckDV adventures and I'll definitely come back with my findings as I get that more polish. I'll be at the hardware catastrophe, put a stop on that for a bit. But,\r \r nonetheless,\r \r I'm really intrigued by the concepts that,\r \r Josiah,\r \r parts in this post here. And then at the end, he recommends\r \r additional packages in the community that if you're still not quite ready for the plunge to Rust for some of these efforts, if you're not ready to build, like, an internal\r \r JSON parser that depends on Rust, There are some additional JSON related packages in the r community that definitely\r \r take a look at. He recommends\r \r the RCPP\r \r SIMD JSON package as a great way for parsing data\r \r as well as the y y JSON package that comes from the affectionately known cool but useless on the our community. He's got a great package called y y JSON\r \r and also JSONify,\r \r which I don't have as much experience with. But you might wanna take a look at each of those too and see it for your parsing needs or writing\r \r serialization needs. If that just gets you good enough\r \r without while being able to stay in the confines of of R directly.\r \r\n\nBut, nonetheless,\r \r this is great learning for me personally as I'm starting to deal with JSON data more and more in my open source work as well as my internal\r \r day job stuff where we just built an API\r \r binding package.\r \r But we're running this in the day to day use with, patient level data set where there's, like, multiple visits,\r \r multiple, obviously, patients in a treatment group, and it's basically doing these get requests to this custom service\r \r 1 at a time\r \r for each of these calls. My goodness. I could do the rec perform parallel and probably speed that up a bit. So I'm gonna have to take a look at this and hopefully not make my IT admins angry when I start to paralyze this.\r \r\n\n[00:52:14] \r Mike Thomas"

I think it's gonna be kind of a toss-up depending on how hot that, certain Luca gets in the in the Dallas side. But it's gonna be gonna be fun to watch nonetheless. But\r \r in any event, we're gonna hear talking about all sorts of things of our data science today. And our curator for this episode or this issue, I should say, is John Calder, another great contributor in our Our Weekly team. And as always, he had tremendous help from our fellow Our Weekly curators and contributors and\r \r members like you all around the world with your awesome poll requests and suggestions.\r \r\n\nAnd we lead off today with,\r \r a great post about\r \r if you've been using, say, the tidyverse align your data science analytics and other work, and you've been starting to\r \r harness those principles and maybe a new package at your organization\r \r or making some functions that are consuming datasets as their main input,\r \r this first highlight today is a great primer\r \r for how you might wanna make your functions a little more compatible, so to speak,\r \r with the main building block of the tidyverse,\r \r data processing object type, albeit the Tibble.\r \r And this post comes to us from Hugo Gruson who is a\r \r research software engineer in epidemiology.\r \r\n\nAnd he leads off this, very succinct post with motivating the\r \r situation. 1st, a bit of those here that aren't aware,\r \r the Tibble is what you might call\r \r a reimagination\r \r or or a slight\r \r update on the typical data dot frame object and base r,\r \r which, of course, holds your rectangular\r \r style data.\r \r The TIBL does a little things under the hood to not so much replace data frame, but,\r \r add some either safeguards\r \r or more kind of quality of life enhancements on top of it. The biggest one that's obvious to you, especially you've been a veteran of r for a few years,\r \r is that if you have a large data frame\r \r and you print that in your console,\r \r oh, you're probably gonna have a wall of text just spinning down all throughout because it's gonna print that whole thing.\r \r\n\nWhereas a Tibble\r \r has a modified print method, whereas I'm gonna show you the first, like, 10 rows or so and then the names of the columns. So, hence, it's a good way to kinda get a quick\r \r glance at your dataset without\r \r overloading your console. That's just one of the minor differences.\r \r But we're gonna talk about some differences under the hood that could affect you if you're writing a function that takes a data frame or a tibble\r \r as input.\r \r And in case in point,\r \r there are, there is a big difference here. And that's the first part of this post here\r \r is that when you subset for a column and, like, a particular column of observations\r \r in a data frame,\r \r When you look at that under the hood,\r \r you will get a vector right away if you use the bracket notation\r \r of, like, the name of your data frame, the opening bracket, a comma to say get all rows,\r \r and then either the name of the column or the index position of the column,\r \r you will get a vector of those observations right away.\r \r\n\nWith a tibble,\r \r not so much.\r \r With a Tibble, if you do that kind of notation\r \r to grab a column out of it, you're actually gonna get a 1 column Tibble back\r \r instead of a vector.\r \r That can be a bit of a problem if you're gonna make a function that does some kind of, like, single column selection.\r \r And that function, like in the example here, a mean function\r \r is expecting a vector of observations,\r \r not a 1 column data frame.\r \r So his advice in this first example\r \r is that you can't rely\r \r on that single column subsetting having that default behavior of a data frame\r \r of what we call drop.\r \r\n\nDrop meaning, like, drop the data frame class and go straight to vector.\r \r Don't don't hedge your bets on that, so to speak.\r \r So in his example,\r \r he explicitly\r \r mentions or explicitly states a parameter\r \r in that bracket style subsetting of the column\r \r with drop equal true.\r \r Then you're guaranteeing that no matter if it's a data frame being fed into this function\r \r or a tibble, that you will get that one column back as a vector of observations,\r \r a vector of numbers instead\r \r of that 1 column data frame.\r \r I have been victim of this in the past when I was writing some packages that\r \r albeit didn't use Tibbles in their main package code, but then I was using Tibbles\r \r as a way to put some nice kinda convenience functions on top of the pipeline.\r \r\n\nAnd that drove me nuts when I just wanted one variable instead.\r \r And then suddenly these\r \r functions I was doing that was doing, like, p value derivations\r \r was just spitting errors at me because it was getting a data frame inside. Like, I couldn't believe it. Sure enough. I was I was running into that little mini inferno about the drop the drop situation. So\r \r sage advice here from Hugo on that because I think that trips up a lot of people when they're starting to make functions that are using Tibbles as an argument instead of just the data frame itself.\r \r But that's not all, Mike, because there's another concept that, admittedly, both you and I have never really paid a lot of attention\r \r to, but that could wreak havoc on your function as well.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:07:24] \r Mike Thomas"

        "trans_text": "No. You're exactly right, Eric, and and I just wanna go back to to your topic really quick. I think anybody who's ever\r \r probably ever developed in our package has been bit by this this drop equals true versus drop equals false behavior, you know, where with\r \r a sort of plain vanilla data frame, you're getting a vector out and with a Tibble, you're actually getting a data frame out, instead of, you know, the vector of the values of the column that you're you're looking for. So if you haven't been bit by it yet, it's this is one to, watch out for. And and another one to watch out for, Eric, as you're alluding to,\r \r is the concept of partial matching, which\r \r I must have seen, you know, somewhere along in my journey but I do not remember this and it's blowing my mind that this is even a thing.\r \r\n\nAnd what we mean by partial matching is when you're using the dollar sign operator on a data frame\r \r to extract\r \r a particular\r \r column\r \r from that data frame.\r \r And we'll use like empty cars as an example here.\r \r If you say empty cars dollar sign s,\r \r it will pull out the speed column because it's going to use partial matching to try to guess which column you were referring to.\r \r And you don't necessarily have to\r \r specify exactly the name of that column to get it out. To me, that's mind blowing. The the fact that we can do that, I'll be totally honest with you, I don't think I really like that. It does not feel safe to me. I'm surprised that it it still exists. I'm assuming it still exists and, you know, our 4 dot 4 dot o.\r \r You know, that the latest release, may maybe it's 441 that's out there now.\r \r\n\nI imagine that this was something that was implemented\r \r in the early early days of r, you know, thinking that that maybe it's a good idea. We wanna make, you know, this language and the syntax as user\r \r friendly as possible.\r \r But to me, oh, man, it gives me the heebie jeebies and and makes me feel like there's a lot of more opportunity for disaster to strike here than there is for efficiency\r \r to be gained.\r \r But, you know, the the idea along this section of Hugo's blog post here is is definitely do not rely on this partial matching,\r \r idea. I don't know too many people who who do rely on it but if you do, it's something that you should certainly watch out for. You can actually set some options if you'd like in your environment\r \r to ensure\r \r that that partial matching, you know, can't be can't take place.\r \r\n\nAnd one of these options is the warn partial match dollar argument,\r \r which you can set to true in your dot r profile file, for example,\r \r which will essentially\r \r ensure that you get a at least a warning,\r \r that a partial match is is taking place and that warning will appear in your console.\r \r You can do the same thing. You may wanna do the same thing in your your test that folder so that your your unit tests throw\r \r an error,\r \r or a warning at least give you that flag if there's partial matching going on that you're not necessarily\r \r expecting, which I think can be a great idea.\r \r\n\nAnd if you you do really need to support partial matching, obviously, this partial matching concept is is only implemented on the the vanilla data frame side and not necessarily implemented on the Tibble side, but you can,\r \r manually\r \r handle it. And Hugo gives an example here of using the the care match function, c h a r match function,\r \r to be able to sort of fuzzy match, partial match,\r \r a column name,\r \r that you're looking for and sort of have the same exact user experience as you would have\r \r with this partial matching against a a pure vanilla data frame,\r \r within a Tibble environment. So there's a nice little code chunk here if you're interested\r \r in doing that. But, again, you know, it's\r \r this is just my opinion only. You know, we're full of hot takes on this podcast and my hot take today, I guess, is\r \r be careful of any partial matching\r \r that's going on. And I think this is a great blog post in general to just warn you about some funky behavior that can take place between data frames and Tibbles that that you may or may not have been privy to. And it's it's definitely something that could easily,\r \r easily trip you up in a script that you're writing or a package that you're writing. So it's great stuff to look out for. Hugo also alludes to and provides a link to a longer vignette that contains all the differences,\r \r between Tibbles and data frames. And I think data dot frames and that,\r \r vignette is from the tibble Tibble package itself.\r \r\n\nOne of the fun pieces about this blog is, that it Hugo\r \r continues to use, the phrase compatible,\r \r which, you know, is a really nice pun that that rounds out this blog post, I think, beautifully. So a great top to bottom,\r \r summary of these sort of 2 funky behaviors\r \r between data frames and Tibbles. And I I definitely think it's a good reminder,\r \r warning to those of us out there to to be on the lookout, stay vigilant for, these differences.\r \r\n\n[00:12:34] \r Eric Nantz"

        "trans_text": "Absolutely. And even had I known about partial matching back in my very early days of of using r back in grad school,\r \r I probably wouldn't touch over 10 foot pole. I am just one of those people that\r \r on the side of caution, on the side of verbosity and specificity.\r \r And I'm gonna put the full name of that variable\r \r no matter how long it is because in the end, a, there are many ways in programming, not just in ARB, but in programming in general, to just\r \r whack yourself silly with, you know, user inflicted issues already.\r \r Last thing I need is partial matching to\r \r wreck havoc.\r \r\n\nAnd I do think it's kind of a you might say, I don't know, relic's the right word, but it's a it's a it's a snapshot in the history of r and s itself because\r \r let's think about what was not around when r and s were built. We didn't have\r \r modern IDEs\r \r and modern frameworks that would support auto completion\r \r in an intelligent way. Like, if you're looking at a TIP or looking at a data frame and you wanna get the name of that variable\r \r and you start typing the name of the data frame, dollar sign, and start typing the name of that variable,\r \r Our the modern editors like our studio and even some of the plugins you get in Versus code and whatnot will let you auto complete the name of that variable. So you don't have to very rely on partial matching\r \r in those situations because the ID is gonna give you a helping hand to help complete that that full name. And also within the tidyverts itself, packages like dplyr, tidy r, and many others\r \r under the hood,\r \r use a package called tidy select\r \r that will let you\r \r grab related variables based on maybe, like, the prefix of their name\r \r or maybe their position or other other ways to intelligently search for these. And, again, what you'll get back is the full name of the variable. It's just a convenience way for you to get there.\r \r\n\nSo, certainly, I think the modern tooling and the modern principles\r \r in the tidy verse hopefully make it that you don't have to support partial matching. But if you have some legacy projects where you do, this post has definitely got you covered on those as well. And then, also, Hugo throws some interesting nuggets at the end here with respect to testing\r \r if you have to really rely\r \r on data frames and Tibbles being, you know, jointly supported in your function,\r \r he has some ideas and some resources that you might wanna use to help make that testing more efficient.\r \r He has some plugs for both the Patrick r package, which lets you do\r \r parameterized\r \r tests with test that, which I didn't know about,\r \r as well as this auto test package.\r \r\n\nAnd that is basically a way to help\r \r scrape your r packages, like example code for, like, your functions.\r \r And then intelligently or dynamically, I should say, kinda change inputs that kinda do some, you know, test generation based on that.\r \r So 2 little nuggets there if you wanna really be robust with not just equipping your functions for the support of tibbles and data frames, but also helping yourself as a package author\r \r to test for these differences in a more systematic way. These two packages could help you out quite nicely there. So lots of knowledge dropped in the short post here.\r \r And rounding out our highlights today, we've got another great showcase of the power of the quartile\r \r documentation engine\r \r with a k a use case that'll be very nice for those of you in the educational sector or building\r \r maybe internal\r \r our trainings that wanna leverage this novel technology.\r \r\n\nAnd we have this highlight coming from the esteemed Nicole Arany who is a frequent contributor to the rweekly highlights\r \r in the past. And she talks about her solution\r \r that combines\r \r the concept of parameterized\r \r reporting in quartile\r \r with dynamic and conditional\r \r logic inside your quartile document itself\r \r to hide or show\r \r certain pieces of elements. And the use case here\r \r is as she wanted to\r \r create exercises\r \r and tutorial material for her students to work through in a workshop session. She's actually taught many workshops that have been shared in the art community. I still wanna thank Nicole once again. You know, I thanked her many times before for awesome workshop and machine learning at last year's our pharma. She did a tremendous job with that, and she built up the materials using quartile, so timely here as well. But in case of this example that she's talking about here,\r \r she had a set of goals that she wanted to achieve here is that\r \r the the document would have a series of questions that the users would have to, you know, write some r code or use r to help answer.\r \r\n\nAnd then a companion document to this that would have not just the questions,\r \r but the solutions\r \r to the exercises\r \r as well. Again, very,\r \r familiar concept to anybody in the educational sector.\r \r And\r \r this approach would not just work for web based formats but also work for static formats as well, such as PDF output. Hence, if you have to do hike a paper version for every reason, I've don't ask me about why I've been looking at static outputs recently. We'll save that for another episode.\r \r But in any event, the first part of this post talks about\r \r what are parameters inside a portal document.\r \r\n\nIf you used Rmarkdown before, this will actually sound pretty familiar to you because it works basically the same way.\r \r In your YAML of a portal document,\r \r you can have a field called params, and then inside it, you can have a series of 1 or many\r \r of these what look like key value pairs, only they're variables that you might give it a name like year. And then in colon, after the colon, you give the actual value of that. So you could define\r \r as many of these as you like.\r \r And then this sup this is supported both with the knitter engine as well as the Jupyter engine. So no matter if you're on the r or Python side, you can use parameters just as easily\r \r in each framework.\r \r\n\nAnd this has been a hugely helpful technique, especially if you're doing automated reporting,\r \r maybe on a ETL or another processing pipeline where you've got the same report, but it's changing like a subset of the data or it's changing a key variable,\r \r but yet the rest of the outputs are gonna be generated in a similar way.\r \r Parametized reports are a great way to, make that happen.\r \r So in the case of this tutorial\r \r example,\r \r she has a parameter\r \r called hide answers,\r \r and the default of this is true, meaning that in the document, it's gonna be one document.\r \r But here's the kicker\r \r is that in the document, she has\r \r put what a what we call these fenced identifiers\r \r around\r \r the type of output\r \r that will only be shown if one of these parameters is set to true.\r \r\n\nSo she has this\r \r in a very interesting way with both the answers being shown as well as\r \r if you're doing PDF output to only show\r \r when the output format is\r \r is PDF in the case of when she renders it.\r \r But this is all combined very nicely\r \r in her quartile chunks of the code\r \r where she's gonna dynamically\r \r put in whether to put in these fence identifiers\r \r of what they call content hidden\r \r based on an inline r code snippet, where if that parameter of hide answers is true.\r \r This is genius here. I love this technique. I, in fact, I was literally thinking to myself, how could I do this of a portal dashboard\r \r to do certain styling elements or certain pieces of the card, you know, styling\r \r if I had a parameter that was, like, longer length than another one. This is the key to make that happen. An inline\r \r little snippet that says, if params dollar sign hide answers,\r \r then put in this fence div of content hidden. And then you can still have the answer in one place. It's all in one document. She didn't make separate documents for this. Hence, we've we're applying the the dry principle here. Right? Don't repeat yourself. Don't make a separate document just for just for one snippet. This is this is terrific stuff. And then in the end,\r \r you see an example where one printout of the screenshot\r \r is asking the question\r \r and then another printout with hide answers false\r \r is showing the actual r code to help achieve that answer.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:21:34] \r Mike Thomas"

        "trans_text": "Yeah. It it's pretty incredible. I would say that Nicola is probably one of the leading\r \r voices on\r \r all of the different gymnastics that you can do with with quarto and especially when it comes to, you know, not repeating yourself,\r \r making things as reproducible as possible and making things as easy on yourself as possible. And this is a another fantastic walk through and I I do just wanna before I forget, thank Nicola for these many quarto blog posts which have honestly helped me and saved me hours, in a lot of the quarto work that that we do at Catch Brook.\r \r So in the conditional content section of of her blog post, she leverages,\r \r again, one of these sort of fenced divs\r \r and you're able to specify,\r \r you know, when a particular format is being rendered to take this action.\r \r\n\nSo the best place to take a look at this is is in the blog post but within this fence div,\r \r she uses the dot content,\r \r hidden\r \r argument followed by the when format\r \r argument and specifies when format equals PDF,\r \r then the content is going to be hidden. So it's a pretty powerful little utility that we have in quarto to be able to take in a conditional action\r \r based upon,\r \r the type of format that's being rendered to. So very very useful,\r \r I think especially for folks who are rendering documents to different formats because let's be honest, you know, sometimes when you're rendering to HTML,\r \r some element, of your quarto document is going to look really nice and when it gets rendered to PDF\r \r either it's going to break or it's just going to look terrible because you know they're 2 completely\r \r different formats.\r \r\n\nMaybe you're taking advantage of you know some HTML content that you know really only belongs on a web page and doesn't belong on a static document or or vice versa when it comes to PDF. So this is a really powerful,\r \r little argument within this fence div that we can create that I think is excellent.\r \r And then maybe the last thing that I'll point out\r \r is,\r \r you know, that there are multiple ways to render\r \r your documents. One is from the command line, which is, you know, utility that that I'll use quite often as well. But if that render call gets a little bit lengthy, you know, for example maybe you have a few different arguments that you're trying to specify.\r \r You know, one maybe being the the output file name if you wanna rename that file, something different than the naming convention that you used for the dot\r \r QMD document.\r \r\n\nMaybe that's something that you wanna specify or if you have parameters, you can use the the, params\r \r flag\r \r of that command line call.\r \r Alternatively,\r \r you may wanna use,\r \r the quarto r package itself and leverage the quarto render\r \r function and specify\r \r these different arguments, you know, a little nicer than this this really wide,\r \r command line call that you might have to be making, if you are trying to set these different flags and specify these different arguments and output file names\r \r and things like that. So at the end of Nicole's blog post, before the additional resources, she has 2 code snippets for how she rendered, you know, the questions\r \r that she created as well as the answers document\r \r that she created in these 2 different,\r \r our calls using the the quarto render function from the quarto\r \r r package which you may be interested in in taking a look at. And the only difference between the 2 is the execute params, execute params,\r \r argument\r \r is specified such that, you know, for the questions hide answers parameter is set to true and for the answers,\r \r the hide answers parameter\r \r is set to false.\r \r\n\nSo that second time that she knits\r \r this document,\r \r the answers will be\r \r displayed. So, she'll create, you know, 2 different documents here which is is fantastic and a great, you know, top to bottom run through on how she went about doing this, all the different considerations\r \r and options and fence divs and parameter options that we have in quarto to make things as as flexible as possible,\r \r not only across, you know, 2 different outputs that she wants to create but even multiple document types. So great great walk through.\r \r\n\n[00:25:41] \r Eric Nantz"

        "trans_text": "Yeah. And, like, echo your your your gratitude and thanks to Nicole for these terrific resources because I was able to use some of her previous materials as well that combined principles that we see in this post here\r \r for my recent,\r \r our consortium submissions working group,\r \r efforts where we have\r \r a document that we have to send as part of this bundle that we transfer to regulators.\r \r We call it an analysis dataset reviewers guide or ADRG.\r \r And I wanted to try something different with this. I could've taken the the typical route and just do a do a Word document, type it all for being was like, no. No. No. No. We're in 2024. Let's do something better here.\r \r So it's a portal document,\r \r but it's got 2 formats.\r \r\n\nBecause as much as I'd love to be able to submit the HTML format, we can't really put that in the bundle, so we do a PDF as well. But we do have conditional logic throughout some parts of the document that we know that for PDF,\r \r it's not going to quite render as nicely with the default font size. So I'll do some code chunk\r \r updates based on the output type.\r \r And then that way, I have a preview version of the ADRG linked on, you know, an HTML\r \r static site hosting area. And then the reviewers can look at that, you know, as as they give me comments and whatnot. But then the actual bundle that we transferred to them, which hopefully be this month, we will be able to supply the PDF version, and it's gonna look, you know, very good, very polished.\r \r But, again, the source is all from one place. We just have conditional logic on top, but still preserving the majority\r \r of that source going to both output types. So I do think this is this is a very novel concept,\r \r and parameters\r \r can you know, we're just scratching the surface of what is offered here. At the end of Nicole's post here, she has doing some terrific additional\r \r either blog posts from Mike Mahoney\r \r or JD Ryan's recent parameterized\r \r quartile reporting workshop as you gave for our ladies\r \r a while back. There's some great additional learning material,\r \r and I can't stress enough how awesome it is to have,\r \r like, a data frame of, like, parameter values in each row, maybe a different configuration of it. Just do a, per walk of that. For each row, run portal render. You got your outputs all generated within about 10 seconds. I did that yesterday, and it was a thing of beauty, my friend. Just a thing of beauty. Music to my ears, Eric. I I love nothing more than the per walk over that that nice little data frame with all your different parameter configuration. So thank you.\r \r\n\nYes. So so once you combine all this stuff, it's like, yeah, I always equate it to being like a a chef that can actually cook because I'm not a chef that can actually cook very well. But with programming, I like to think I can mix and match these quite a bit but I'm certainly not alone. We're learning from the call and many of the other\r \r thought leaders in this space here.\r \r And it never stops learning when you look the rest of the art weekly issue, and John has done a tremendous job for the rest of the issue here. So we'll take a couple of minutes to talk about our additional fines that caught our attention for the week.\r \r And going back to the concept of Tibbles and concepts of, like, the building blocks of the tidy verse,\r \r There were some some great posts that were\r \r illuminating a concept in tidy yard that I did not know was possible.\r \r\n\nThere are a couple posts here from Lael Lecri\r \r on the use of a Tidyr function called packing\r \r versus the concept of nesting, which we often hear about more fully\r \r with respect to creating your Tibbles.\r \r And if you're like me, when you first saw this issue or thinking,\r \r packing? What is that? Well, you can think of packing as, like, a slightly different take on how the data frame is being collapsed.\r \r Nesting is kinda like doing a row based collapsing. You're gonna have\r \r maybe a set of columns that become\r \r their own table, but it reduces the number of rows in your data frame as a result. We often do this in group by\r \r processing and whatnot.\r \r\n\nPacking is kinda taking the opposite approach.\r \r It's gonna keep the same number of rows, but then it's gonna make a table out of various columns,\r \r and then you can unpack it to make it wider again.\r \r And so there these two posts are gonna talk about the comparisons of the 2, when you might wanna use 1 versus the other. And in particular, I mean, I still have a lot to learn in this area here, but she did eliminate some interesting examples. If you have jason type data, why am I want to look at packing\r \r versus nesting and those concepts? So again, just an illustration that\r \r I always think I I know most of the tidy verse, but there's always something I don't know. So we're all we're all learning together on this. But, Mike, what did you find? So I found that the Geo Aero package, I think, has its first release on CRAN. It's version 0.2.0,\r \r\n\n[00:30:39] \r Mike Thomas"

You can just click that, and you'll be taken directly to the poll request template\r \r where you can put in markdown syntax, that great link, that great resource that you found,\r \r all marked down all the time. We live marked down. We love it. Hence, Hence, some quartiles have been great with markdown as well. So all just a poll request away to get your resource in the issue.\r \r And, also, we love hearing from you and the community as well.\r \r\n\nWe have a few ways to get in touch with us directly.\r \r One of which is in this episode show notes. We got a link to the new ish contact page that you can send us a message on there. And I did hear back from a listener that wants to do some interesting,\r \r I guess, meta analysis on our past show notes. I'm gonna, you know, give that's gonna be exciting. So I'll definitely get in touch with you about that.\r \r And, also,\r \r you can also send us a fun little boost in the modern podcast app if you're listening to, say, paverse,\r \r Cast O Matic,\r \r fountain, many others in this space. So you can send a little boost directly in the podcast app, and we'll get that message directly to us about any third party middle person\r \r in between.\r \r\n\nAnd speaking of podcasts,\r \r I guess I had a busy, couple of months recently because I was on another show recently\r \r hosted by my good friend Barry at Pod home talking about my adventures of podcasting and data science, and I'll have a link to that in this episode show notes. That was that was great fun to join Barry on that on that episode.\r \r So I will link to that from the about podcasting show.\r \r That was great fun.\r \r And, also, you can get in touch with me on the social medias these days. I am mostly on Mastodon.\r \r We've got our podcast at podcast index.social.\r \r\n\nDoing a lot of fun dev work now behind the scenes with the podcasting 2.0 stuff and getting real gnarly\r \r with JSON data. It's been a fun learning adventure to say the least.\r \r I'm also on LinkedIn. Just search for my name. You'll find me there as sporadically on the weapon x thing with at the r cast. And, Mike, where can the listeners get a hold of you? Sure. You can find me on mastodon@mike_thomas@phostodon\r \r\n\n[00:34:43] \r Mike Thomas"

        "trans_text": "But, you know, it's not lost. We got another fantastic issue to talk about today, and our curator this week was our another longtime member of the rweekly team, Jonathan Carroll.\r \r And as always, yeah, tremendous help from our fellow rweekly team members and contributors like all of you around the world with your poll request and other suggestions.\r \r And it's fun when you can lead off with,\r \r you might say, straight from the source, if you will, because we have a blog post\r \r straight from the r development blog itself\r \r on some of the latest patches and enhancements that have been made into base r to support\r \r a new frontier of object oriented programming systems.\r \r\n\nAnd if you're coming into base r, you may have noticed that there are\r \r 2 built in object oriented programming systems right off the bat with no additional packages needed.\r \r These are called s 3\r \r and s 4.\r \r They both accomplish similar things, albeit they go about it a bit differently.\r \r But you will find that, for instance, a lot of the tidyverse packages have been built upon s 3, whereas other packages in your ecosystem,\r \r especially those around the bioconductor side of things, have links to s 4. And we've covered in previous episodes of benefits and trade offs of each of those.\r \r But ever since about a year and a half ago, there has been a new effort,\r \r a joint effort, I should say, between the Arcore team as well as developers\r \r of, say, the tidyverse\r \r and other community related packages\r \r on a new object oriented programming system that is now called s 7,\r \r which right now is available as a standalone package that you can import into r.\r \r\n\nBut with the advent of s 7, it has provided\r \r the R Core team a time to reflect, if you will,\r \r on how to maybe help out packages like s 7 in the future become\r \r part of the base r installation.\r \r And they've identified\r \r a few key gaps, if you will, of ways to make this\r \r journey of incorporating\r \r into base r a bit easier.\r \r And this blog post in particular talks about a set of 4 different patches that have been landed\r \r ever since our version 4.3.0\r \r that are going to pave the way\r \r for an easier onramp of s 7 and perhaps other packages in the future\r \r to take advantage of some of these principles\r \r that have been built into R for quite some time,\r \r but to help give a more friendly interface around these.\r \r\n\nWe'll do a quick recap of each of these 4, but we're gonna, you know, buckle up a little bit. We're gonna get pretty technical here. The first one, probably the most technical here,\r \r is the concept\r \r of how dispatch works with respect to different object types and different operators.\r \r If you don't know what dispatch means in this context, it is really the concept\r \r ascending a generic, which is another word for function that's supposed to have, like, one name\r \r such as plot or summary,\r \r but take different actions depending on the type of object being fed into it.\r \r And so it'll say, hey. If I wanna do a summary of a data frame, it's gonna do, like, a quick five number summary of each, you know, variable in your data frame versus for a model object. It's gonna give you those model fit convergence\r \r statistics, those likelihood statistics,\r \r and other information.\r \r\n\nAnd typically for s 3,\r \r a generic will use the first argument that is passed into that that that that method call\r \r to help determine where it dispatches.\r \r S 4\r \r kinda takes a more general approach. It could be any number of arguments\r \r in that call that help determine\r \r which method gets dispatched to. S 7 is somewhere in between. It has this intricate kinda double dispatch system And\r \r even\r \r I'm not\r \r quite sure how that part works, but, luckily, for the rest Even I'm not quite sure how that part works, but, luckily, for the rest of this explanation,\r \r we really need to know that because\r \r now since version 4.3,\r \r they are now\r \r helping the situation\r \r where\r \r it's not always just like a summary or, you know, other function like that. A lot of the operator functions in r, such as like the plus or the multiplication\r \r or many of these others,\r \r actually are built on 2 arguments. Right? You don't see it, but the left hand and the right hand side of these operators are like the 2 arguments to the actual function itself.\r \r\n\nWell, before\r \r this patch,\r \r it would always\r \r if there was ever a mismatch in the types of arguments that are in these kinda operator type methods,\r \r r would warn you, hey. These aren't the same type, and it wouldn't dispatch anything that was based on those.\r \r Now since 4 dot 3, there's a new function built in the base r called choose ops method\r \r which is gonna let an object type\r \r declare\r \r that they are in fact based on a combination\r \r of different methods for that argument pair, not just one method.\r \r Where this is really gonna come into play\r \r is the situation where you have a pretty complex method\r \r that wants to\r \r do, like, these operator methods\r \r that is meant to do a unique thing,\r \r but be able to take an account that these argument types going in\r \r could be more than one type.\r \r\n\nAnd they use an example from reticulate\r \r in this piece, which I think is quite interesting here. But for those aren't aware,\r \r Reticulate is the RPAC is a interfaces with Python under the hood, and, hence, it's going\r \r to find a way for your r code to go to the appropriate Python method.\r \r But especially in the space of machine learning and other methods like that,\r \r sometimes these operators, they might wanna build a custom, you know, method on.\r \r They're gonna have different things inside each of the left and right side, if you will. So in the example they have in the post, it's based on TensorFlow\r \r where you might have an interesting object\r \r that's based on a tensor,\r \r tensor itself, which is a Python object, but you might wanna add to that, like, a simple array in Python or whatever.\r \r\n\nWhereas in for for r4.3,\r \r it wouldn't know what to do because these are 2 different object types. But now\r \r with this choose ops method,\r \r reticulate can say, okay. For this unique type of combination\r \r of an array and a tensor object,\r \r dispatch to this particular method.\r \r Now you may never really encounter this in your day to day development, but as a package author dealing with some more novel and more intricate class systems,\r \r this is going to be a big win for many people. So it's going to pave the way for more flexibility\r \r in these situations of building your own method\r \r on these, what you may call classical operator type functions.\r \r\n\nAnd speaking of those classical operator type functions,\r \r there has been one that's kinda had a unique, you might say, history\r \r and where it's invoked.\r \r And that, in particular,\r \r is the multiplication\r \r surrounded by percent signs.\r \r If you've done any, like, math in r or maybe in your graduate school or over class training,\r \r you probably use this when you had to multiply matrices together if you're learning the ropes of linear algebra and the whatnot.\r \r Prior to our version 4.3,\r \r this only worked with either s 4 objects or base r objects.\r \r Well, guess what? Now that in 4.3,\r \r there is a way to have now a new generic\r \r category called matrix ops\r \r where it's gonna have this built in operator as one of its first citizens of it, so to speak.\r \r\n\nBut package authors and developers of new object class systems\r \r could help put in new methods into this. And they say in the future, within base r, they're going to fold in the cross prod and the t cross prod,\r \r functions\r \r into this family.\r \r So they do admit this is meant for backward compatibility,\r \r but it's also\r \r intending this to let other packages have to do with operations\r \r that are more unique in this situation\r \r such as s 7 in the future, be able to do the appropriate\r \r classification\r \r of these methods.\r \r And, yeah, we're we're not quite done yet. We got 2 more to go.\r \r One of these\r \r is also\r \r filling a need that can be inconvenient or maybe it was a bit difficult in the past\r \r of trying to figure out for an object type what class it inherits from.\r \r\n\nThere is a function in base r called inherits where you put in as the first argument the object itself,\r \r and the second argument\r \r of the name of the class that is meant to check if it inherits from.\r \r Well, a lot of these class names that for an s three standpoint\r \r were kind of built in as an attribute\r \r and not really meant for human consumption. It was not meant to be very syntactically,\r \r you know, very easy to understand, apparently.\r \r Well, now\r \r in the inherits function ever since version 4 dot 3,\r \r you can now\r \r have arbitrary\r \r objects as that second argument that you're gonna use the check for inheritance of that first argument,\r \r which means you don't have to memorize or go in source code to figure out what is that name of that s 3\r \r object type that you're or class type that you're checking from.\r \r\n\nYou can now feed in a logical name of this\r \r or an object itself. So the example they have\r \r in s 7 where they define a class called class x,\r \r they give an object called class x of that new class,\r \r and then you can now use that as a second argument instead of a string\r \r trying to guess what that class type is.\r \r So that's also meant for use of s 7 to get into base r eventually,\r \r but there's no reason other packages can't\r \r inherit that same idea.\r \r Again, similar to the Python side of it where you might have in your reticulate\r \r package, build down reticulate,\r \r maybe a new class name that can be a lot easier to type for the user.\r \r\n\nLast but certainly not least,\r \r if you're familiar with s 4, if you ever explore that, the way to get into\r \r what we call slots of these objects in your creative s 4 has been the at sign. It's kind of been like the dollar sign to me when you would use that in, like, your data frame, dollar sign, name a variable.\r \r In s 4, it's been quite similar. You would have your object that was built in s 4, use the at sign, and then you would start typing in, like, the name of either the method or the slot that you want to get more information on.\r \r Well, this never worked for anything besides s 4.\r \r\n\nWell, now, ever since 4.3,\r \r now that can be used with s 3 dispatching as well.\r \r I still don't quite know in my day to day when I would would actually use this, but they do give justification for this by saying that s 7\r \r is taking bits of s 4, albeit these more formal definitions\r \r of slots and other formals that are going into these class types.\r \r And now, if you have that muscle memory of using s4 and this at sign to get into these different slots, you're going to be able to use this of s 3 and s 7 now as well.\r \r Again, not sure when I'll use that day to day, but, again, many of these changes\r \r are paving the way for an eventual future state\r \r of s 7 becoming part of the base r installation.\r \r\n\nSo I think it's one of those things we're gonna see the fruits of this labor more down the road.\r \r But if you ever had questions on what our\r \r our core project is doing\r \r to get this state ready. This blog post is definitely for you, especially if you want a primer on how these are gonna make your life at developing a new object oriented programming system or building a a PONCE S3\r \r or the new S7.\r \r\n\n[00:14:16] \r Mike Thomas"

This is this is pretty exciting stuff and it's interesting to me to see how\r \r Posit and the RCCOR team are coming together on this initiative as well as some others, you know. It's really cool to have that,\r \r collaboration out there between, you know, the brightest minds in the some of the brightest minds in the R ecosystem.\r \r And if I understand it correctly, I think the the road map here is that this new framework is\r \r currently out there as an R package called s7\r \r for developers to, today if you want to,\r \r download, install, and kick the tires on it for a while.\r \r\n\nAnd then once the team feels that the package\r \r is stable across a wide variety of use cases, I believe the idea is to bring s 7 into base r.\r \r And I don't know if there's any specific timeline on\r \r that that we saw in the blog post.\r \r Not not yet. It looks like it's still got some work to do. Yeah. So I I would imagine that it's gonna be a function of how much use this s seven r package\r \r gets, and how many folks out there can download it and and try it out, and how many edge cases, they can find before they they finally feel that, s 7 is is stable enough\r \r to bring into base r. But, this is all, you know, I think extremely exciting stuff for those who are trying to, you know, sort of push the boundaries of what R can do. I I think,\r \r a lot of the\r \r power\r \r behind, this object oriented programming approaches\r \r is actually in making\r \r sort of the the end user's life easier and making the UX for, you know, our users that maybe don't necessarily need to know or care about,\r \r you know, methods, classes, object oriented programming,\r \r make, you know, their day to day jobs easier. Just like you said, Eric, we have these these generic functions,\r \r you know, summary. You can call that against a a data frame and get your your quantiles for each column, or you can call it against the model object. And each,\r \r you know, for for most\r \r authors of of our packages\r \r that contain predictive modeling frameworks,\r \r they all typically implement their own sort of summary generic or or print generic as well against the model objects that those packages offer. And the ability to sort of do that and custom tailor what the end user is going to see on screen is is really cool. It's really powerful. And for those of us in our early in our our journey or even, you know, intermediate in our our journey, the fact that we just sort of get that nice functionality\r \r for free,\r \r is is fantastic. And it it makes everybody's life easier. I think it contributes to some of the reasons why R can be a friendlier language for some folks to pick up. So, you know, the fact that we're getting some additional, you know, extension functionality, you know, beyond s 3, what s 3 can do in this new s seven implementation, you know, particularly with with sort of that second argument idea, I think is going to go a long way to continuing,\r \r to help, you know, those hardcore\r \r r developers make, everybody\r \r everybody else's life a lot easier.

So you don't want that in your home memory. Guess what?\r \r IRL comes compatible with dplyr\r \r functionality,\r \r so you can use this to query for just the parts of data you need.\r \r And in particular, in the example that Kyle walks through here, he has an example of filtering the coordinates based on San Francisco, I e the state of California\r \r where he was able to grab the actual coordinates,\r \r from, I believe, another package to get the coordinates, right, the bounding boxes.\r \r\n\nAnd then\r \r once you have that well, of course, we're visual.

And lo and behold, if you're looking at this in your modern podcast app, you'll see in the chapter image marker, you got a really nice looking topology layout of San Francisco\r \r that looks pretty darn cool if I dare say so myself.\r \r\n\nAnd so Kyle was curious.\r \r It looks like the u United States portion of this data has a little more fleshed out,\r \r building data, so to speak. He thought, what's it look like in the rest of the world just to kind of test that, you know, hypothesis out? He did the same kind of code, but instead of going to the US, he went to Sydney, Australia\r \r to see what kind of topology he would see here. And you do see that there's only maybe looks like about 15 or 20\r \r buildings that are represented here, which obviously we know Sydney is a big city. Right? So there's gotta be a lot more to it.\r \r But this just goes to show this iterative\r \r nature or might say the early stages\r \r of this initiative. So perhaps\r \r there will be others in the community that start contributing more data to the Australia side of things or other parts of the world.

I used, you know, you you we've talked about this a 1000000 times on the the podcast before and my love for Parquet k as well as the arrow package.\r \r I recently used DuckDV for the first time last week finally.\r \r I had a 25,000,000\r \r by 50 column SQL Server table that I wasn't about to to try to write summary queries\r \r against because I I tried to do that once and it it did not end well. Let's just put it that way. So I was able to to write that out to parquet using a a chunked approach,\r \r and the new I think, ADBC,\r \r that database connection\r \r for,\r \r for the Arrow framework\r \r and wrote that out to Parquet, and then I use DuckDV to query this this parquet file that ended up being, you know, I think around 1 gig for these 25,000,000\r \r rows by 50 columns sequel server table,\r \r and the the queries that I was running with DuckDV were taking like less than a second.\r \r\n\nIt was\r \r it was insane. It was incredible.\r \r So I can't I can't sort of recommend these frameworks enough for, you know, high performance,\r \r data analysis. And this is a fantastic use case of bringing a few different tools\r \r together, in terms of some of the Tidyverse ecosystem, the Arrow project, some of these other data visualization libraries, and then this new deck dotgl\r \r library, which is incredibly exciting. And, like I said, sort of the outputs here are are really visually appealing and nice. So it's a fantastic blog post,\r \r to to have out there. So thanks to Kyle.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:29:07] \r Eric Nantz"

        "trans_text": "Yeah. Absolutely. In fact, I've even just thought of a a use case for this myself in a rather geeky project where I'm starting to\r \r interface more with some interesting podcast metadata,\r \r and some of it is\r \r the location where downloads are occurring from. You know?\r \r Maybe I could use this to map out the downloads of our weekly highlights on a nice little map, so to speak. So I'm,\r \r you know, cover me intrigued then, and I I still think parquet is becoming the new CSV\r \r in a lot of our data science circles, and this is just yet more more credence to that. So, yeah, really, really fun to learn about the innovations in this space as well.\r \r And last but certainly not least on our highlights section today,\r \r we, in this,\r \r quote unquote loss episode last week, we we had a great discussion on ways that\r \r have been explored to help automate\r \r some refactoring of tests.\r \r\n\nWell, we're gonna make good on it because we have part 2 of that series here. We're gonna talk about the highlights here, and this comes to us from Al Salmon who, of course, was a former contributor here at rweekly and now is a research software engineer with rOpenSci and rhub and synchro as well.\r \r And this is part 2 of her quest\r \r to refactor\r \r test files in one of her packages.\r \r And, again, last in her her post last week, which, again, is on last week's our weekly issue,\r \r she had a fantastic,\r \r albeit\r \r quite in-depth\r \r system\r \r of using a combination of parsing our code\r \r and XML\r \r representation\r \r of code\r \r to find calls to certain expectation\r \r functions and be able to swap them on the fly by how having to do the infamous control f find and replace\r \r for all these hover instances. Well, we're we're getting a little bit more, human readable here, so to speak, in terms of automation versus,\r \r you know, some principles that I think\r \r on paper they make complete sense.\r \r\n\nBut, again, you got to put it into practice. Right? And, I already have\r \r one project where I put maybe half of these in practice, and I'm gonna go back and put the rest in practice. We'll kind of hit these 1 by 1 here, but a lot of these are gonna relate to not just test, but also your base r code as well for your package or other routine.\r \r Make variable names that actually make sense, and this also applies to your test suite as well\r \r because it may be tempting if you're, like, doing a similar expectation by just varying, like, 1 or 2 things,\r \r kinda reuse those variable names over and over again.\r \r\n\nNo. No. No. No. No. Don't do that. It'll make the bugging a lot worse, especially if most of those expectations\r \r pass\r \r except for one thing here and there. So\r \r having variable names that\r \r make make more sense to you when you read it,\r \r don't be afraid to make them verbose. I like long variable names if it helps my cognitive function. And so\r \r don't worry about, you know, trying to be with that. Again, you are probably the one that's gonna read this the most. So be nice to future you on this. And speaking of variable names,\r \r you, again, may be tempted to use the same ones\r \r across different tests if they're all doing the similar type thing.\r \r\n\nYou know, you might wanna change those up a little bit. So in her example here,\r \r she's got a function that has, like, 3 different modes of complexity,\r \r and she changes\r \r those inputs going into the expectations based on that mode, if you will. Easy, medium, and hard\r \r versus, like, x x x for all of them. So, again,\r \r tailor it to the way you as a developer can help move your debugging when these expectations\r \r are not passing.\r \r And then\r \r as you're developing these expectations,\r \r you may think about, oh, when I wrote this package,\r \r I had, like, all my objects created above, and then I put them, like, my processing functions below that or whatnot.\r \r\n\nMaybe for testing, you don't wanna do that. Maybe you wanna put\r \r the the objects you're creating\r \r related to the expectation that it's testing with\r \r and put those groups together instead of, like, all your objects in one part and then all your expectations\r \r in another part.\r \r Again, some of this is subjective, but, again, when you're debugging things,\r \r it may be much more straightforward to have these logical groupings of the object and expectation\r \r with each other\r \r instead of, like, everything in the preamble of your test and then every expectations\r \r all below it. So, again, these are all nice enhancements,\r \r but\r \r she's not done there. She's got a lot more here, Mike, that I think you could definitely relate to as a as a developer as well.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:34:06] \r Mike Thomas"

        "trans_text": "Yeah. Unit testing is a a funny thing, Eric, because\r \r some of\r \r the sort of best practices that you might think of in terms of how we like to author\r \r our code,\r \r can sometimes go by the wayside or or not necessarily make as much sense within a unit testing\r \r framework. And,\r \r you know, her her last sort of section\r \r here that she talks about or as you were discussing before is maybe not, you know, create all those different objects\r \r and then run your sort of expectations,\r \r you know, against those different objects that you previously created, but keep everything sort of logically together. So if you're about to execute a test using, you know, expect,\r \r equal or expect greater than or something like that,\r \r you should have\r \r the object that you're using in that test or objects that you're using in that test\r \r as close to that as possible.\r \r\n\nAnd and I think that that makes a lot of sense. You know, when I'm reading some source code\r \r of developers that I, you know, admire\r \r and and try to mimic, I think that that's something that I see, you know, quite often in their their unit tests within their test that folder is that everything is is sort of chunked up nicely into different sort of logical\r \r sections where they they have a per very particular thing that they are trying to test\r \r and, you know, they have that that very much segmented in one location.\r \r However, you know, sometimes\r \r you're trying not to\r \r recreate the wheel all the time as well and there may be opportunities\r \r maybe at the header of that file before you start executing any of your unit tests to create a particular\r \r particular object that you're going to actually pass and leverage in a lot of the different tests that you're running. So there's some trade offs here.\r \r\n\nA lot to think about. I I again,\r \r I say this I feel like every time I'll author a blog post but I feel like these topics aren't something that's talked about very often. So it's it's really nice to have someone out there who is talking about,\r \r her opinions and best practices, you know, most of which I I sincerely\r \r relate to. But these are a lot of things that I've had to learn the hard way, sort of, by trial and error,\r \r over the years and not necessarily had a lot of content out there to follow.\r \r So very grateful for Mel for for putting this together. And and maybe the last,\r \r point that she puts out is is try to use a a bug summary and not just maybe the issue number that you're solving as your test name. You know, if you go back and take a look at a test, you know, where sort of your test that,\r \r first argument there is just the string that says, you know, bug number 666\r \r is fixed as Mel uses for an example.\r \r\n\nShe certainly prefers that you you write that string to say something like, you know, my awesome function does not remove the ordering. You know, sort of,\r \r maybe providing the summary\r \r of that issue as opposed to just the issue number itself. So that when folks are going back to to understand it and look at the tests that have been written,\r \r It's very easy for them to be able to see\r \r exactly what's taking place in these tests, what has been solved,\r \r what maybe still is open and needs to test around that. And she recommends, you know, use that summary\r \r as that string, that first argument to your test that call,\r \r but but maybe you can have a comment within that that has a link,\r \r to the particular bug report or that git GitHub issue, so you have sort of the best of both worlds there. So a great great,\r \r blog post here again by Maelle. I really appreciate her covering a a topic that I think doesn't get enough attention, and I definitely learned a lot here. Yeah. Me as well.

        "trans_text": "in the past couple weeks, I've been bolting on some really interesting unit tests for a shiny app I'm about to put in production. But guess what? As much as it may seem like a paradox, Mike, 90% of those tests have nothing to do with shiny. It's about the business logic, which again is a pattern that may not be as obvious as a Shiny developer. But guess what? Because the business logic is just based our code if your summaries or visualizations\r \r or over, you know, in this case, some Bayesian modeling.\r \r These are all things that we can take principles that Miles outlined here and as well as her previous posts on developing best practices. So I have her blog on one tab. I have the r packages\r \r tab on or open on another tab. The r packages book by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Brian. And so these have been greatly helpful. And, yes, there is some shiny test to match. I got the end there for what I call a more end to end user focused view of it.\r \r\n\nBut, boy, if I have confidence in the business logic and I organize these tests such that I know exactly\r \r where to go if something fails. And sure enough, I had some failures\r \r with a survival object outcome where I was like, wait. Why didn't it work for binomial and continuous? Why not for survival? Sure enough. I was doing a dumb thing in one of the inputs and the processing functions. But the expectation covered it, and I knew exactly where to go. So it does help future you. You've just gotta try it once.

It passes the, the r curiosity test, if you will, is the rest of the rweekly issue because we got a lot of great content for you to continue your learning journey on with new packages, new blog posts, great new resources for you to dive into.\r \r So as usual, we'll take a couple of minutes to talk about our additional finds here.\r \r\n\nSpeaking of learning,\r \r this is definitely gonna be relatable to those who have\r \r children here in the US have started their summer breaks. Right? They're,\r \r they're not using their,\r \r their course web pages now to get homework and whatnot.\r \r But most of those schools here in the US build their learning systems on something called canvas.\r \r It's a learning management system.\r \r Mike, you're gonna know about this in a few years. Trust me on this.\r \r And most of their most of the teachers will use this to help bring out assignments\r \r or, you know, get in touch with their students, add resources, and whatnot.\r \r\n\nWell, if you are a maybe teaching a, who knows, maybe a stat or math course,\r \r and you wanna use r in it, but you wanna help use r to help automate some of your\r \r management of these resources, well, there is a package for you.\r \r This package is called vv canvas. This is a package to automate tasks in the Canvas LMS,\r \r and this has been authored by Ewin Tomer. And this is actually part\r \r of what was new to me,\r \r a verse of package is called the Vusa verse,\r \r which is a collection of our packages\r \r tailored to student analytics\r \r with respect to teachers using these in their courses and and other systems.\r \r\n\nSo this package basically builds upon the Canvas API\r \r If you wanna use r to help automate certain tasks, like creating, you know, assignments\r \r or\r \r finding metadata of assignments and whatnot.\r \r Looks really interesting if you're using this system with respect to your teaching.\r \r And as usual, as I say to many people,\r \r if there's an idea, there's typically a package for that. Well, little did I know there will be a package for the campus learning management system. So that was a new one to me. So maybe if you're one of these teachers that are on your quote unquote summer break and you wanna supercharge\r \r your, learning pipeline for administering your course and you use R, maybe this is for you. I have no idea.\r \r\n\nUnfortunately, as a parent, I can't leverage this API. They don't give me the keys for that. But, hey, if I was ever teaching, I would. I\r \r\n\n[00:42:10] \r Mike Thomas"

So\r \r very good to know. Very, very good highlight. I've got a couple for us. I will wanna shout out Stephen Paul Sanderson\r \r who has a bunch of little bite sized,\r \r posts which are are just fantastic little nuggets. One is called how to remove specific elements from a vector in r. He walks through,\r \r approaches using baser,\r \r d player,\r \r and, data dot table, I think. He has a a little,\r \r blog post how to split a,\r \r number into digits in r, which is fantastic. It's actually a use case that I had with with DuckDV,\r \r which has fantastic,\r \r function to be able to do so to split a a particular value by a delimiter into an array.\r \r\n\nAnd then it has a second function for picking the element of the array that you want but that's just a a tangent,\r \r based upon some rabbit holes that I had to dive down recently. So I want to shout out,\r \r Steve Sanderson for these great bite sized posts. Then I also wanted to shout out Epsilon for this contest that they are having,\r \r to win a, I believe, professionally designed HEX logo\r \r for your r package.\r \r You have until May 31st\r \r to sign up for this. So you have a couple more days left. You have to provide some details about your r package, package,\r \r name, purpose, functionality, and some links and, briefly describe the design that you're looking for, design concept, any preferences that you have for the logo, and you could win a professionally designed hex logo for your r package. And if you've seen any of Absalon's,\r \r I think\r \r newly sort of rebranded\r \r or redone,\r \r hex logos, I'm thinking about the tapper\r \r package which is,\r \r I believe\r \r is that on the Shiny for Python side? That's their Yep. Rhino That's their kind of rhino like wrapper. Yes. For building modularized,\r \r Shiny for Python applications.\r \r\n\nThese HEX logos look super clean, super modern,\r \r really really cool. So if you did win this, I have no doubt that that the design that your R package would get for its hex logo would\r \r be be very fresh,\r \r and would be, you know, sort of way ahead of of most of the competition in the R ecosystem. So very exciting stuff and and thanks to Absalon for running that contest.\r \r\n\n[00:44:38] \r Eric Nantz"

So if you see a great new package or great new blog post that you think should be\r \r highlighted or or be part of the next issue, It's just all markdown text. Very simple. Just give the hyperlink.\r \r\n\nWe give a nice little contributor guideline there right in the in the template so you can, you know, fill out that information.\r \r Again, very straightforward.\r \r If you know Markdown, you know how to contribute our weekly. It is just that simple.\r \r And as well, we'd love to hear from you as well. There are many ways to do that. We have a somewhat new contact page because yours truly forgot that we moved to a new host that my previous contact page was gonna be null and void. So I've got a new one up. The link has been updated in the show notes, so you'll get to that right there.\r \r That's actually some custom HTML in that, by the way.\r \r\n\nI'll be\r \r found a template online to do it, but credit to our podcast our podcast host called Pod Home for giving me the keys to be able to do that. So that was kinda cool in any event.\r \r You can fill out that as well as if you're on a modern podcast app, such as PowVerse, Fountain, Cast O Matic. There are many others out there. You can send us a fun little boost along the way right directly in your app itself,\r \r and these modern apps are gonna be where do you get to see those fancy chapter image markers\r \r on top of the chapters themselves so you can kinda get a little visual cue every time we dive into another topic.\r \r\n\nBut, of course, we are also available on these social medias. I am, Mastodon mostly these days\r \r with [email protected].\r \r And my quest to bring r to the world of podcasting 2 point o just hit another milestone recently.\r \r I have now open sourced a new package called 0p3r,\r \r which is a front end to the OP 3\r \r API service by John Spurlock that gives open podcast metrics.\r \r And, yes, now I can visualize our weekly highlights metrics\r \r with my same package with a little deep fire magic. So more to come on that as I dive into to more on this, escapade that I'm on. So, that was, that was from my interview,\r \r podcasting 2 point o. Adam Curry himself said, yeah. Yeah. It'd be nice if we did that OP 3 stuff in your dashboard. I'm like,\r \r duly noted. So new package as a result. Boardroom driven development nonetheless.\r \r\n\nBut I'm also on Twitter, x, whatever you wanna call it with that the r cast sporadically,\r \r and I'm also on LinkedIn.

That was apparently\r \r more of a reality check than what Dave was expecting in terms of data quality\r \r of the podcast index database. But it was a ton of fun, And, apparently I've given him some things to follow-up on, which we may be touching on in one of our highlights here. But again, thanks to them for having me on, and I've been anointed the podcasting 2 point o data scientist. So I'm gonna take that and run with it. Pretty cool. Add that to your CV, Eric. I'm super stoked to listen to that episode. Today, I got a long car ride this afternoon and I will be tuning in. So,\r \r\n\n[00:02:01] \r Mike Thomas"

So that's just a tip of the iceberg or some of the things that dev community is up to. But, nonetheless, we got some great art content to talk about here and our curator this week's for this week's issue was Sam Palmer,\r \r another great contributor we have in our our weekly team. And as always, he had tremendous help from our fellow our weekly team members\r \r world with your awesome poll requests and suggestions.\r \r\n\nAnd, Mike, we're gonna I guess guess this first high is gonna be a kind of a trip down memory lane, but I'll be at a visual aspect of it in ways I totally did not expect until we did\r \r research for this show. Oh, yeah. Exactly. So our first highlight today is coming from the esteemed Matt Dre who has been a frequent contributor to our weekly\r \r and past issues.\r \r And in particular, he's been inspired by a resource that admittedly little old me did not know about until now, but is called the aesthetics\r \r Wiki,\r \r which in a nutshell, what this is is\r \r a Wiki portal, but it's a very visually themed Wiki portal where it's got a collection of images,\r \r colors,\r \r links to musics and videos that\r \r help give you a vibe, if you will, of a specific maybe time period or a specific feeling in mind. And I met when I looked at this and I was going coming through some of the, you you know, the top Wiki pages,\r \r there was one about the y two ks issue from way back. And, I could I could definitely got the memory triangle. I'm looking at that Wiki portal,\r \r but I'm also getting vibes. And so this is gonna date myself quite a bit, so bear with me here. But, yeah, I had cable TV growing up and one of the, guilty pleasures I had was on VH one watching the I love the eighties, and I love the nineties series because it was\r \r such a fun trip down memory lane for each of those years of those decades. And I will still stand on my soapbox here. And at the eighties nineties were the golden age of video games, so take that for what it's worth. But in any event, I I definitely got those same vibes here. And apparently, Matt was inspired to think, you know what? On this Wiki,\r \r there's something missing.\r \r\n\nIt's the R language, of course.\r \r What could we do to visually depict certain, I would say,\r \r major stages\r \r in the evolution of our,\r \r for respect to this kind of theme on the aesthetics Wiki.\r \r So I'm gonna lead off with probably the most appropriate given yours truly is the old timer on this show\r \r with the first period that Matt draws upon is called base core.\r \r And the picture on the blog post definitely,\r \r gives you some vibes of\r \r there's a lot going on under the hood with our, but it's, you know, kinda scattered around. It it's it's got a lot happening.\r \r And he talks about some of the bullet points that inspired the imaging here\r \r because of if you know your our history, it actually came in the mid nineties.\r \r\n\nIt was derived from the s language and then to our from Rasa Hakka and Robert gentleman\r \r and then base core as we know it was founded in the year 2000.\r \r And if you have old r code laying around from that time period,\r \r I eventually gonna have 3 major operators in there one way shape or form.\r \r Bracket notation for referencing rows or variables,\r \r dollar signs for referencing variables inside a data frame, and the tilde's for your linear regression model fits and whatnot.\r \r He also mentions that if he was gonna put this Wiki together, he would have\r \r a link to the,\r \r writing our extensions PDF, which I've combed through a few times in my early career, but it's, not for the faint of heart if you're if you're new to the world on that.\r \r\n\nBut, yeah, the the the vibe of it is very, you might say, utilitarian,\r \r kind of mundane a little bit here and there, but the potential is there. So I really like what he put together there. And of course, in the in the blog post, it's in our post after all. He's got a code snippet that looks straight out of my early\r \r r classes and graduate school\r \r where you've got the assignment operator referencing\r \r rows with the double equal sign in the brackets,\r \r the dollar sign for referencing variable names\r \r and FL's\r \r aggregate, you know, bay from base are, and then finally ordering it by height. In this case, it's a data set of star wars worlds and characters. And in the end, you get a nice data frame of the average heights\r \r for those living in Tatooine or Naboo and others.\r \r\n\nSo\r \r I feel seen when I see that because if I look back in my old land drive here in the basement, I have lots of code that looks just like this. But our\r \r many\r \r other developments have happened.\r \r And the next period\r \r that Matt talks about will be something that I think will look pretty familiar to most users now. He calls it the tidy wave, Mike, and I would say it's anything but mundane.\r \r\n\n[00:07:28] \r Mike Thomas"

But on to the Tidy Wave as you'd say,\r \r he he talks about the history sort of starting in 2,008 and then later\r \r being popularized,\r \r mostly through the Tidyverse, sort of wrapping\r \r up a lot of,\r \r this different tidy functionality\r \r in 2016\r \r when that was originally released.\r \r\n\nThe key visuals here are the mcgritter pipe,\r \r the data placeholder\r \r as a period or a dot, and then the tilde,\r \r not being used for formulas but being used for Lambda functions\r \r in this iteration\r \r here.

        "trans_text": "I love this because\r \r this is one of those situations where we are seeing another big evolution, but it's so fresh. May not fully grasp it yet. But the visuals of this\r \r have big roots into one of the most major developments in the our language itself of the last few years. And that is the introduction\r \r of the base pipe operator,\r \r which, again,\r \r one could argue that the tidy verse popularity you just summarized\r \r was a direct influence on this feature coming in alongside other languages having similar mechanisms.\r \r And in 2022,\r \r it was\r \r released fully, in support of our the the base pipe. So that is, of course, one of the key visuals here along with the underscore, which is not just for variable\r \r name separations\r \r between words,\r \r but as a data placeholder,\r \r similar to what you mentioned earlier with the period and the and the previous summary\r \r and a new notation for Lambda functions, which, admittedly, I'm still wrapping my head around, but it's the slash with the parenthesis afterwards. I\r \r admit, Mike, I have not actually written that one out yet. You're gonna have to pull the tilde for lambda functions out of my cold hands, so to speak, but I am warming up to it. It's just taking a while.\r \r\n\nSo the fashion here is this one's really funny. It's, you might call evil mustaches\r \r and posts on Fostodon and memes up the wazoo on various blogs.\r \r There there's a lot a lot going on here with the pallet being, you might say, very, you know, unified and pleasant, a rainbow pallet.\r \r And his nearest aesthetic that he finds on the Wiki that would correspond to it is and, again, I feel seen when I see this vacation\r \r dad core. Apparently, that's full of dad jokes and other visuals that those are kids probably put your kids through embarrassing moments or whatnot. Not that I've ever done that. But,\r \r the sample here\r \r is gonna look very similar to the sample you saw in the tidy verse sample above,\r \r but substituting for the base pipe, substituting for the new data placeholder and the new Lambda function notation.\r \r\n\nBut guess what? This is monumental, folks, because now,\r \r a very important feature in many languages is now\r \r in r itself. And who knows what the future holds here?\r \r But in any event, it's gonna be a wild time. I'm sure\r \r as more companies adopt new and later versions of r\r \r and say version 4 dot 1 and up going into production systems depending on your organization.\r \r But it is, a fast moving space and who knows what the rest of the future looks like. But, again, I can't stress how monumental it was for the r language to adopt\r \r this operator\r \r after this many years. It does show that the team is not resting on its laurels. It is definitely\r \r keeping up with the time, so to speak.\r \r\n\nSo it was this was this was a fun\r \r fun new take on the evolution of r itself, and, I can't wait to see what's next.\r \r\n\n[00:12:24] \r Mike Thomas"

Eric, it's pretty wild that in that last code snippet that uses entirely base r, looks so strikingly similar\r \r to the prior code snippet that was using all dplyr,\r \r verbs. It's it's pretty incredible, I guess, where we've come, you know. I don't know if this is a cherry picked example totally\r \r because, you know, you this works great until you get\r \r to a particular base art function that you wanna use that that maybe its first argument, right, isn't necessarily\r \r what's being piped\r \r into it. I know there's there's some placeholders to help you you get around that,\r \r but I do think that that maybe there's potential use cases that the Tidyverse can handle\r \r better than what we have access to in Base R, but, you know, there's also use cases here as Matt clearly demonstrates\r \r where you can just leverage what's straight out of Base R, and it's it's pretty wild.

It is\r \r very mind blowing to me that after all these years, we have this\r \r capability\r \r that I think for those\r \r that are new to the language. And again, there will be opinions on this across the spectrum. So just take the Eric's opinion here. But when you look at the readability of this from a person new to the language,\r \r outlining all the steps that are happening in the state of manipulation,\r \r transformation\r \r of new variables,\r \r summarizing all that in a group format and calculating these derived statistics.\r \r\n\nI know for those coming from other languages, certain ones with proprietary name to it. This syntax is gonna feel more at home than what we saw in the in the good old days. But then again, I still have that old cold for a reason. It's always fun to look back. That's right.\r \r And next on our highlights\r \r very, hot and much talked about\r \r duck DB format for databases and how that compares to what you may have done in the past in tidy verse pipelines within particular,\r \r the deep wire package.\r \r And this highlight today is coming from\r \r Dario Ridicic who is a senior data scientist at Neos, and he's published this on the Epsilon blog\r \r talking about how you can take advantage of DuckDV to enhance your\r \r data processing pipelines in your ecosystem.\r \r\n\nWe have we have definitely mentioned DuckDV\r \r before, but if you're new to it and in particular,\r \r I mentioned being on the podcast in 2 point o show on Friday, I offhandly mentioned duct d b as someone else looking at for some of the podcast database and I, I had, Dave, scratch in his head a little bit. I'm running, oh, I gotta follow-up on this. So, Dave, this is for you.\r \r If you and those also that have not heard of DuckDB before, but\r \r this is a database\r \r system, but there are there are definitely different classes of database systems.\r \r One of which is the more traditional,\r \r there's a client interacting with a server process somewhere. And this is where if you heard of MariaDB,\r \r MySQL,\r \r Postgres,\r \r sequel\r \r and others.\r \r\n\nThese are very prevalent in the industry, but they often have a pretty heavy footprint,\r \r yet they are quite valuable in in the industry sector and other sectors as well. And then you have what are called in process\r \r database systems. These are ones that you can run directly on your computer\r \r as a file format,\r \r so to speak\r \r with where the data stored. And then there's some layer in your system is gonna interact with that.\r \r And the most historical one that's had the most popularity\r \r and still does to this day is SQL light.\r \r And that's where you just have to install a compliant front end on your system, have a SQLite database file on your system. And then you're able to read that into your preferred language.\r \r\n\nDuck DB is in that same space.\r \r So it does share some similarities of sequel light, but there are some interesting differences\r \r that may be worth your time to look at as you're thinking about, you know, database evaluations\r \r for different formats\r \r is that DuckDb is designed for\r \r data analysis, and the abbreviation here is OLAP for online\r \r analytical processing.\r \r This is massive if you're gonna have situations where in your database, it's not just querying for the existence of particular rows or existence\r \r of things. It's actually performing analytics on the fly\r \r much like we do in the tidyverse pipelines a lot where we're gonna aggregate by groups. Gonna derive mean\r \r values or\r \r or or medians or other statistics.\r \r\n\nAnd probably have to do that with complex, you know, indexing as well.\r \r DuckDV is tailor made for those situations.\r \r And so the other selling point of DuckDV these days that it is first completely open source, and that's of course a win for us and the data science community.\r \r And it is relatively dependency free,\r \r which means that it can be run on a variety of systems and architectures,\r \r including\r \r web assembly, which is some I'm very intrigued to buy for sure.\r \r Now it's not all roses and unicorns.\r \r There is some mention\r \r of disadvantages for DuckDV.\r \r\n\nI think it's more limited depending on your use case here. It's probably not the best for constant writing to the database file.\r \r But for most of my needs,\r \r I'm not usually writing a lot concurrently\r \r like I would say for an IoT device device or other digital device that might be hammering an endpoint multiple times per second. Most of the time in my day job, I'm analyzing\r \r these data from source and doing more complex\r \r operations.\r \r And you're not gonna get, like, the distributor set up like you would with a client server model for, say, postgres\r \r or Spark or other ways that you can have a database layer that's networked across multiple\r \r nodes on, say, a a VPS provider.\r \r\n\nBut, again, you're in a different use case already in that point.\r \r So and the upper part that is to keep in mind, it is still a fairly new project.\r \r They certainly had a lot of progress, but it doesn't have\r \r quite the maturity at a sequel light. But with that said, there is a lot of advancements\r \r happening in the community here, and I do think DuckDV, especially the integrations,\r \r what we can do with web assembly technology and other systems,\r \r even as lower scale as a Raspberry Pi, I think are really thought provoking on what you can do with this. But as an r user, you may be thinking yourself, I'm very comfortable with dplyr.\r \r What's in it for me to move to DuckDb?\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:19:48] \r Mike Thomas"

        "trans_text": "Yeah.\r \r So in this benchmarking\r \r that that Damien,\r \r puts together here between dplyr\r \r and DuckDb.\r \r I believe\r \r he used,\r \r tried to aggregate about 38,000,000\r \r rows\r \r that was spread across 12 different parquet files. And if you're not familiar with the parquet file format, we've talked about it a lot on this podcast. It is, in my opinion, sort of the new CSV. It's it's columnar\r \r storage that makes analytics,\r \r very efficient. It compresses the data in a way that makes your files, these parquet files, much smaller than if you were storing them as something more traditional like a text file or a CSV, but we have plenty of other other links and episodes that that discuss that.\r \r So Damon used the, taxi\r \r data, the the very famous yellow taxi,\r \r the dataset,\r \r to be able to create sort of this large 38,000,000\r \r row dataset in 19 columns,\r \r that takes\r \r a a little less than 1 gig of disk space, I think 630\r \r meg, he said.\r \r\n\nAnd that's, you know, quite large for trying to do some analytics\r \r on natively.\r \r So one thing that he was able to do with with dplyr\r \r was to be able to,\r \r create this dplyr pipeline just using, 3 verbs here, 3 or 4 verbs. It looks like mutate,\r \r where he's creating a couple different date type columns, the ride date and the ride year,\r \r using lubridate\r \r to be able to parse those things, from a date time column. He's filtering,\r \r for only ride years in the year 2023,\r \r And then he he's grouping by these particular dates and taking a look at a few different median statistics, like the median distance, median fair amount, and median tip, as well as the the ride count, which is just a simple count. And he reproduces that same exact logic,\r \r using dplyr verbs\r \r again, but the second time it's against this this dplyr table connection,\r \r that connects via duckdb,\r \r the the DB connect, DuckDb\r \r driver,\r \r against these parquet files. Again, you're able to just have DuckDb sort of sit on top of and interact with these parquet files as opposed to DuckDV,\r \r being the database itself. You do have both options similar to SQLite. You can actually create a DuckDV database\r \r file if you would like. But you can also just use the DuckDB engine to operate against parquet files, which is what is going on here, and I think is is probably what you'll see more common out there in the wild these days and act in terms of, data storage\r \r as opposed to actually storing, you know, your your data\r \r itself as the stuck DB database.\r \r\n\nHe also demonstrates that you can if you didn't wanna write the dplyr code, you could write,\r \r an entire SQL statement that does this exact same thing,\r \r within the DB GetQuery\r \r function,\r \r from\r \r the DuckDb,\r \r package which would allow you to, you know, express your logic, all the CTL logic in SQL as opposed to dplyr.\r \r But now here's sort of the big results here. We're trying to look at this this little dplyr chain and how it performs,\r \r in in Raw dplyr as opposed to\r \r using the DuckDV engine under the hood. The dplyr approach takes almost 15 seconds to do this aggregation, which results in a data frame that I think is,\r \r they're they're showing about 16 different,\r \r observations here, 16 rows\r \r across these,\r \r 4 different,\r \r statistical columns\r \r that get computed,\r \r and then the DuckD\r \r b, as opposed to the 15 seconds that it takes in deep prior, the DuckD b approach takes less than one second.\r \r\n\nSo it's it's pretty incredible.\r \r Damien knows that they have, triple checked this statistic and that the numbers are correct, and DuckDb here is almost 20 times faster\r \r than dplyr, which is is pretty incredible and right that, you know, a lot of times when especially, you know, in the context of, Eric, a lot of what you and I work on in terms of Shiny apps and trying to make those UXs as\r \r seamless,\r \r frictionless\r \r as possible, you know, moving some of that ETL from something like, you know, raw dplyr or base our code,\r \r to leveraging, you know, DuckDB or Arrow\r \r can create these these drastic orders of magnitude gains inefficiency\r \r that that really make that user experience,\r \r tremendously better than it would be otherwise. You're not having to have people, you know, continue to wait around for something to happen for these ETL chains to run.\r \r\n\nSo this is a great great walk through, great use case. I would also recommend maybe a couple other,\r \r functions out there and some pieces of documentation out there. I think there's actually a function from the arrow package\r \r called to_duckdv,\r \r which allows you to sort of start with an Arrow object,\r \r but leverage the DuckDB\r \r engine,\r \r on top of Arrow to make that pipeline even faster and to allow Arrow and DuckDV to integrate seamlessly\r \r together, which is is fantastic.\r \r There's also a blog post\r \r sort of on that same,\r \r vein on the DuckDV website. I just realized it's from from 2021,\r \r but it had been, you know, getting shared around on on Twitter recently,\r \r which is called DuckDV Quacks Aero, a 0 copy data integration between Apache Arrow and DuckDb. So maybe I can share that in the show notes as well.\r \r\n\nBut it certainly seems like, you know, this is sort of the way of the future in terms of ETL. It's certainly the way that we're doing a lot of stuff at Catchbook right now for our ETL pipelines, and it's it's making a huge difference for us. So it's a really exciting time\r \r to be able to leverage and see all of these,\r \r really nice ETL data processing\r \r improvements and tools that we have now.\r \r\n\n[00:25:40] \r Eric Nantz"

        "trans_text": "Yeah. And there was a situation actually came up at at the day job last week when,\r \r there was a user that thought that was Deepfire just having really bad performance on a certain situation. And, of course, they tried to get more details because we don't wanna just vague request like that. But, apparently, they were analyzing\r \r a 7,000,000\r \r row dataset,\r \r which, yeah, if you're just gonna ingest that in native our sessions without a helper like duct DB or even SQL life for that matter,\r \r it's going to be a long time to produce aggregations and summaries on that kind of set. And it didn't help that this set was in SaaS format, but that's another story for another day. But in any event, imagine\r \r if that dataset is getting split up into parquet files or intelligently by groups, And then you take the same kind of code that was demonstrated by Damien over here\r \r and to be able to run that very efficiently or Dario should back. Try that again. And imagine if you take the same code that Dario puts together in this post\r \r with those parquet files again, like you said, correct me. My I feel is that the new CSV,\r \r There's a reason I linked to those\r \r as extract downloads in my podcast index dashboard. I didn't wanna do CSVs anymore\r \r trying to push this as the other communities as well to look into this. But you are gonna get tremendous gains in these situations with with DuckDV\r \r on the back end. And one addendum that I would be interested in trying on, maybe I will when I get some spare moments,\r \r is it was, what, a week or 2 ago on this very podcast, we had covered the release of the Duck plier package,\r \r which again is a very similar vein to what Duck DB package itself is doing here, but it is a even more of a direct one to one replacement for dplyr.\r \r\n\nIt is still newer, so we're keeping an eye on its development.\r \r But you could probably leverage the majority of that same code\r \r into a duct flyer pipeline, and I would venture to say you're gonna get those same performance benchmarks because it's all Duck DB\r \r under the hood anyway. But we'll definitely have a link to Duck plier as an additional thing to explore here. But I see, again, massive potential\r \r in the spaces that you and I operate on in both of my day job efforts. But now, as I mentioned in my open source efforts of this podcast database,\r \r my portal dashboard\r \r kind of takes a quote unquote easy way out where I've through GitHub actions, I'm doing all the processing\r \r outside the dashboard and the dashboard is simply referencing them directly via RDS files that are being downloaded on the fly.\r \r\n\nI am waiting for the day where I can swift flip that up to do web assembly,\r \r DuckDV in inside that, and then I can do the real time querying, so to speak, in that dashboard as a Shiny Live app instead.\r \r It's coming, Mike. It's coming. I just need the time to do it.\r \r\n\n[00:28:44] \r Mike Thomas"

It is literally in my same industry about ways that I've been envisioning for\r \r ever since I've heard about this technology,\r \r where I think the potential is, and we are seeing that here. And in particular, this last highlight is coming from the pharmaverse\r \r blog\r \r and authored by Paolo Rucci, who is a data scientist developer\r \r at Roche.\r \r And for those unfamiliar, the pharma verse,\r \r if you're in the r community, you've like you heard of things like the tidy verse and whatnot. Well, this is a\r \r collection of packages that are helping\r \r make clinical\r \r pipeline\r \r analyses,\r \r data processing\r \r that we routinely do in life sciences\r \r much easier to do in the our ecosystem as ours now taking a much, stronger footprint\r \r in the life sciences industry.\r \r\n\nWell, one of the suites of packages and the pharma versus, you know, getting popular\r \r is the nest packages and others to help produce\r \r what one might consider the backbone of what we call a clinical submission to regulators\r \r for a given study,\r \r and that is the production of tables,\r \r listings, or graphs or TLGs for short.\r \r Traditionally, these have been done in a certain proprietary language, but that's not we're gonna talk about here because r has made tremendous strides in this space.\r \r And as a way to get new users or to show off the potential of what's possible with the pharmaverse in this in this, part of the pipeline,\r \r The pharmaverse has produced for a while now the TLG\r \r catalog,\r \r which has been a snippet for the common table listings and graph types that we often do in submissions,\r \r but with the r code to actually produce those and a snapshot of the output.\r \r\n\nWell, what, Paulo was talking about in this post is they have now\r \r integrated\r \r WebR,\r \r hence WebAssembly,\r \r into this portal site\r \r to not only show the code,\r \r but to let the users\r \r run the code themselves,\r \r change things on the fly,\r \r experiment with the existing syntax.\r \r My goodness. This is just a massive win for learning in this space. I am geeked out about this already.\r \r They had me there, but as the game shows will say, but wait, there's more\r \r because\r \r another popular part of the pharmaverse has been the teal framework,\r \r which is a way to bring interactive data exploration with these common summaries\r \r into a Shiny application with a set of reusable modules and packages\r \r to help with different analytical types, different parts of the processing,\r \r but teal is a great way to ingest these clinical data for review\r \r in your given systems to explore for new insights and whatnot.\r \r\n\nWell, guess what? With the advent of shiny live, Powell is also plugged in a way to run a teal application\r \r tailor made for each of these table summaries\r \r inside that same website, folks.\r \r This is massive. I cannot underscore how enthusiastic I am about this because\r \r think of the doors this is opening. Right? Is that\r \r there will be, many in life sciences that are new or newish to our for a lot of these clinical analyses.\r \r Anything, and I mean anything we can do to make this easier for them to transition,\r \r we need to take that and run with it as fast as we possibly can. This TLG catalog, I think, is amazing\r \r first step\r \r in this vision. So I whoever you're in the pharma industry or not, just take the ideas from this. Think about how this could be used in your use cases\r \r for whether you're teaching\r \r new users of r or you're trying to demonstrate to your leaders what is possible when you mirror the technologies of open source and web assembly together. This t o g catalog\r \r is a massive vision. I or a demonstration of this vision\r \r that I think can be applicable to many people. And, yeah, when I saw this, I'm like, I'm IMing some people at work. I'm like, you need to see this folks. This is amazing. So I'm definitely gonna be pursuing this very closely. But, again, what an excellent showcase\r \r of WebAssembly,\r \r quarto,\r \r and the pharmaverse\r \r all in one place. Absolutely massive, Mike.

And,\r \r yes, I am very, you know, much a fan of the web assembly frame, but I haven't forgotten about my explorations with container environments.\r \r And that's where this another mind blowing moment for me from this issue\r \r is that James Balamuda, who goes by the cultless professor on the various social handles,\r \r he has been the pioneer\r \r of that web r extension for quartile and whatnot,\r \r but he has put a spectacular\r \r demonstration on his GitHub organ profile here\r \r that has\r \r a, custom\r \r dev container setup,\r \r which for those aren't aware of dev containers are a way for you to bootstrap\r \r a container environment in versus code\r \r or get hub code spaces.\r \r\n\nAnd he's got one that's actually 2 of them that are tailor made for both building portal documents and with newer extensions such as the web r extension\r \r and the pile died extension if you're doing Python based,\r \r web assembly products.\r \r But also these dev container features have one that works in the traditional GitHub code space, which will look like Versus code in your browser.

So this is a great\r \r great blog post, touching on that subject again. I can't get enough of that content, so that's a great shout out as well. Another thing that we do a lot of, so this spoke to me quite a bit, was that there is a new release\r \r of ShinyProxy,\r \r version 3.one.0.\r \r\n\nAnd for those who aren't familiar, ShinyProxy is a platform for\r \r hosting Shiny applications.\r \r It's it's clear fully open source,\r \r but you you host these Shiny applications,\r \r heavily\r \r via Docker such that\r \r each user,\r \r when they click on an app on your your ShinyProxy\r \r platform, it spins up a separate Docker container\r \r for that user,\r \r and that allows you to to leverage things like Kubernetes fairly easily,\r \r and it does allow for some, you know, additional security. You're able to deploy\r \r your Shiny apps,\r \r as as Docker images, which is is really nice in terms of reproducibility\r \r as well. But, you know, ShinyProxy is something that that we leverage pretty heavily both internally and for our clients. This was exciting to me and I know that there's some other folks out there that,\r \r leverage this project as well as it's it's one of, the the multiple Shiny hosting options that you could have. And the new features in ShinyProxy,\r \r 3.1\r \r are, as opposed to what I just said, you know, when a user clicks on an app, it spins up a a brand new separate container for them. In 3.1.0,\r \r we have the option for some pre initialization\r \r of that container or sharing of that container across multiple users. So,\r \r sometimes when a Docker container sort of is is spinning up depending on how large that image is, it can take some time to spin up and users may have to wait, you know, 5, 10, 15 seconds,\r \r something like that, for that container to spin up and for them to actually be able to see their application. So\r \r 3.1.0 provides some opportunities for pre initialization\r \r of those containers and actually sharing,\r \r containers across users such that an already running container can be leveraged, by a second user.\r \r\n\nThe other, big update is that, you know, up to now, ShinyProxy\r \r supported 3 different container back ends. That was Docker, Docker Swarm,\r \r and Kubernetes.\r \r Now there is a brand new back end, AWS\r \r ECS,\r \r which is pretty exciting. I think AWS ECS,\r \r allows you to or or maybe, they take care of some of the server setup,\r \r and scaling\r \r that you might have to have rolled your own, if you're using Docker, Docker Swarm, or Kubernetes. So it's nice that that abstracts it away from you. But as Peter Salomos notes in his, hosting data apps blog that that recaps this 3.1.\r \r O release. You know, one downside of of AWS ECS is that in most cases, it takes more time to start the container compared\r \r to other back ends. But now that we do have this this pre initialization\r \r and container sharing capabilities in 3.1.0,\r \r we might be able to reduce that startup time to something that's that's even less than a second,\r \r if we are able to take advantage of those new features. So, there's some additional stuff in there, but but really exciting,\r \r for myself and maybe those others in the community that that leverage ShinyProxy.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:44:28] \r Eric Nantz"

These are fantastic\r \r updates, and I can underscore the importance of that\r \r pre initialization\r \r feature because\r \r sometimes with whoever you're, you know, sending this to, you might have to,\r \r have to think about, okay, what are the best ways to enhance user experience. Right? And loading times is unfortunately one of them for better or worse. So be able to have that ready on the fly, I think, is massive.\r \r And for all the DevOps engineers out there that may have been, you know,\r \r what we call an r admin that's administering shiny proxy or maybe working with IT\r \r to support that. What I really appreciate,\r \r as you mentioned, Mike, with the ECS, you know, new back end implemented,\r \r If you're wondering how that might fit for some of the automation, like deployment pipelines,\r \r they linked to in this post\r \r a,\r \r a repo that has an example for Terraform, which is a very popular dev ops, you know, system configuration\r \r platform for automation. So I I I have a few HPC admins in my day job that would appreciate seeing that because that's Terraform all the things with Chef. So this might be something that if we do shiny proxy in the future, I'll be sending this their way. But, yeah, really, really exciting to see these updates for sure.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:45:43] \r Mike Thomas"

I've gone kinda far, but I've been learning up on Chef and Ansible\r \r and a little bit of Terraform, but, there's only so much time in the day. But, nonetheless, there is so much more we could talk about in this issue, but we would be here all day if we did. So we'll just invite you to check out the rest of the issue at rnp.org\r \r along with all the other resources that we mentioned in this episode as well. It's all gonna be in the show notes.\r \r And by the way, if you are listening to this show on one of those more modern podcast apps like pavers or found, you may have noticed we've actually upped the production quality to show quite a bit where now you get not only the chapters, which we've always done, we've got chapter image,\r \r images\r \r that will directly link to each of the highlights that we talk about. So I think that's pretty cool if you're taking advantage\r \r of the modern tooling here and also\r \r a big win for accessibility,\r \r each episode now has a transcript directly generated into the show, which,\r \r ironically, even Apple has adopted recently. So you should be able to get that in many of the podcast apps that you listen to this very show. And, we love hearing from you and the audience as well. But, of course, the art weekly project itself goes\r \r with the community. It's powered by the community.\r \r\n\nSo if you see a great resource you wanna share with the rest of the art community, we're just a pull request away. It's all at rwiki.org\r \r and click in the upper right for that little GitHub icon, and you'll be taken to the next week's issue draft where you can put in your link. And our curator of the week will be glad to merge that in after a review.\r \r And, also,\r \r we'd love to hear from you as well directly.\r \r There are many ways to do that. The fun way, of course, is if you're on one of those aforementioned podcast app, you can send us a fun little boost along the way, and we'll be able to read it directly on the show. And,\r \r it was fun to be on the Friday show because I I did get a few boosts sent my way because I was part of what they called the valued split at that point for that segment. So lots of fun shout outs about the r language and whatnot and are nerding out on that side of it. But, also, you can contact us on the various social media handles.\r \r\n\nI am mostly on Mastodon these days with at our podcast at podcast index dot social.\r \r I'm also sporadically on x Twitter, whatever you wanna call it, with at the r cast\r \r and also on LinkedIn. Just search for my name, Eric Nance, and you will find me there. Mike, where can the listeners get a hold of you? Sure.

At that point, you know, when you get to game sevens, they're a coin flip. But, yeah, once they got through that\r \r pesky, Toronto Maple Leafs, now they're gonna they're gonna give those, dreaded Panthers a run for their money, it looks like. So fun times ahead for you. We'll see. We'll see. Well, revenge in action because last year, they, they got a rude awakening and 7 games from them. So maybe\r \r the revenge factor strikes again like it does in pro sports. But,\r \r yep. But we don't have any revenge to conduct against each other. We're good friends as always. But, of course,\r \r this issue is, of course, not built by us. It is built by the R weekly team. And in particular, this issue was curated by the esteemed Colin Fay, of course, the architect of all things GOLM and many of our shiny awesome\r \r packages.\r \r\n\nBut, of course, he had tremendous help from our OurWeekly team members and contributors like all all of you around the world. Well, if you had to guess where we're gonna start, it's probably not so much a mystery because this has been making the waves for the past about 2 weeks now in the R community and even other tech sectors outside of R itself.\r \r We are, of course, talking about the recently disclosed\r \r critical\r \r vulnerability exploit or CVE\r \r that was disclosed with respect to the serialization\r \r of particular r data types with the RDS format.\r \r And we had a little bit of a mention of this last week because it was literally late breaking as we're recording\r \r in last week's episode. But if you're not familiar what we're talking about here, it was about,\r \r about near the end of April, April 29th, to be exact.\r \r\n\nA vendor called Hiddenware,\r \r who I've not heard of before this particular story,\r \r had this had disclosed the vulnerability\r \r called CVE\r \r 202427322.\r \r I don't expect you to memorize that, but all the links are in the show notes.\r \r But this is describing that an exploit that you can\r \r utilize in previous versions of R\r \r up to version 4.4, where apparently this has been patched,\r \r where you can inject arbitrary\r \r code to be executed\r \r into an RDS serialized\r \r file\r \r through means of clever uses of the headers inside that file\r \r and taking advantage of concepts like PROMISE for evaluation\r \r and the like.\r \r\n\nWe won't read that post verbatim here. You can look in the show notes for it.\r \r But as I expected, when this broke, I thought there would be some additional either fallout slash follow-up\r \r from the community, especially for those that are in tune with both the intersections of data science\r \r and infosec or information security.\r \r And this first highlight is one of those responses we're gonna dive into along with a bunch of related\r \r resources.\r \r And this post comes from Ivan Krivlov, who I believe has been featured in previous highlights.\r \r And his post\r \r succinctly titled,\r \r everything you never want to know about the r vulnerability,\r \r but shouldn't be afraid to ask. I think that's an awesome title\r \r because this is really going to break it down piece by piece\r \r in terms of what this practically means\r \r in terms of our day to day for the usage of R and just what is going on under the hood.\r \r\n\nOne thing that we're going to say right off the bat\r \r is that\r \r this\r \r specific instance in this CVE is just one example of how potentially, and I do mean potentially,\r \r someone could exploit certain features of the R language\r \r to, you know, do malicious things on a on a somebody's system and whatnot.\r \r But these are features\r \r of the language itself, and R is most definitely not alone\r \r in having these features in place. We'll get to that in a little bit.\r \r But in essence, Ivan starts off the post\r \r with kind of some background on the RDS and R data file formats.\r \r Where they are, their job is to directly represent\r \r the state of an art type of object.\r \r\n\nAnd I mean really\r \r represent it. In essence, serialize it such that it can be completely reproduced on another system or another installation of R via the loading functions for that particular object.\r \r Now these objects\r \r do, by nature,\r \r often contain code that needs to be executed on the system related to R itself.\r \r A good example that he calls out here is a lot of those model fit objects that you might pass around based on a linear regression fit or whatnot.\r \r It's gonna contain code VSA s three methods or others under the hood\r \r to do certain things with, say, the data that was supplied in that model fit, looking at model assumption, you know, model metrics and whatnot,\r \r that's by design, folks. That's always\r \r been there.\r \r\n\nSo, yes, what this vulnerability really is is just finding clever ways to inject\r \r additional\r \r execution of code\r \r in these places, in these serialized objects so that you could take advantage of it.\r \r But if you really wanna get really deep it, it's not that easy.\r \r He does have examples talking about the anatomy\r \r of a particular vulnerability like this, of how you might have to get into\r \r the source of R itself and how it serializes\r \r objects and try to interject things in between if you want to do something really\r \r nefarious.\r \r\n\nBut in the end, this is all things that have happened in other languages as well. And that's where he leads off with, at the end, you know, our friends in the Python community, this is something they've been dealing with for years\r \r with respect to an arbitrary\r \r serialized object called pickle,\r \r often used\r \r in machine learning model fits, prediction modeling in general.\r \r There's nothing stopping a nefarious person from injecting\r \r Python code.\r \r He got somewhat hidden in that object where if you don't know to look for it, you might miss it.\r \r But I'm going to take a step back here and think about an example that I've been telling people as they've been asking me about this.\r \r\n\nWe live in this era of digital communication. Right? And what is the most you know, one of the most direct means of communication these days\r \r is the good old email message. Right?\r \r You often have text and email, but you might also have something else with it called attachments.\r \r And I know in my organization,\r \r they put us through very rigorous training\r \r to say, did you get an attachment with someone you trust?\r \r If not, you might wanna think twice about opening that up on your system.\r \r And that's where I think the CV is bringing the light\r \r maybe something that I don't know if glossed over is the right word, just hasn't been talked about much, is that these\r \r serialized data objects\r \r have always had this capability.\r \r\n\nThe question is, do you trust\r \r the process that's building it and who is sending that to you?\r \r And with that, on top of Ivan's post, we've got other terrific resources here that I'll put in the show notes\r \r that really dive into the practicalities of what the CV really means.\r \r In particular, Bob Rudis has an excellent post on his blog,\r \r and he is very, opinionated on this. Although, frankly, I share his opinion.\r \r This probably never should have been a CVE in the first place. Again, this is not a unique problem to R.\r \r This is the language operating as, quote, unquote, its design.\r \r\n\nIt doesn't take away\r \r our responsibility\r \r as end users\r \r to be, you know, critical of when we're receiving these data objects,\r \r verifying the source. And in particular, he's got a proof of concept in his GitHub repository\r \r that will let you scan these data objects to look for potential vulnerabilities or potential\r \r nefarious code injections inside.\r \r That's just one example.\r \r And another great example linked to is Josiah Perry\r \r just has a very brief or to the point video on his YouTube channel\r \r about how you can take advantage of these exploits as well, again, using fundamental features of the language\r \r that are not gonna go away anytime soon, nor they should\r \r of you know, executing arbitrary code in s 3 methods\r \r and other, you know, methods that you get when you load a data object into your memory.\r \r\n\nAnd then a couple other things before I, well, glide down here\r \r is that the concept of CVEs in general, while, of course, I acknowledge they are hugely important\r \r in the realm of security,\r \r there's always more than meets the eye about this. So I found this great interesting post from Daniel Stenberg\r \r who has a interesting take on the CVE process and some of the nuances behind it in light of disclosures back a few years ago with respect the curl utility\r \r and other frameworks.\r \r Just something to have in the back of your mind as you see this reported in the general tech sector\r \r of these outlets that aren't really going really deep into this story. And that's what we're trying to do here. We want you to give you the resources to do more follow-up on your own and make your own call about what this means to you. We're just sharing what it means to us.\r \r\n\nAnd then lastly, if this whole data serialization\r \r topic is new to you, like it was to me even just a year or so ago.\r \r Another link I'll throw in the show notes is Daniel Navarro\r \r has an awesome blog blog post, easy for me to say, about how data serialization and r really works, in particular, the RDS format. So you can kinda see the nuts and bolts of how this works. So my takeaway is\r \r I think this v CVE, while I don't really agree with how it was disclosed and\r \r highlighting a feature of a language itself that's not in and itself a vulnerability.\r \r I am at least\r \r you know, happy is probably not the right word, but I am glad that it's bringing to light\r \r the the discussion that we've had internally in my company, but also others in the community\r \r about really being responsible about how we're using these data that's supplied to us or being built by these other processes.\r \r\n\nSo I think that's good that's good discussion to have. I've seen it on Mastodon. I've seen it on LinkedIn and other places.\r \r So maybe it is that wake up call that the community needed that the art language has grown enough in popularity\r \r\n\n[00:11:20] \r Mike Thomas"

        "trans_text": "that now we really have to think critically about these methods that could potentially be used again for nefarious means. But, Mike, I've rambled enough. What's your take on all this? No. Eric, I share a lot of the same thoughts, and it's I'm glad that you pointed out Danielle's, blog post there because that was one that came across my mind when I was reading, you know, all the different blog posts around this topic because really what underlies\r \r the issue here is, you know, serialization and deserialization\r \r of of our objects and how that works. And I think\r \r a large, you know, sort of,\r \r point to projects like the the Parquet project was to try to get away from some of that serialization and deserialization\r \r of language agnostic\r \r or or yeah, language specific,\r \r I should say, you know, formatted objects like RDS files, like pickle files, and to try to be able to store data in more of an agnostic way, that doesn't involve serialization that allows users,\r \r to be able to to to work with that data no matter, what language they're in. But obviously, we don't have something like that when it comes to something like a model object, right, or storing, you know, pretty much anything else, you know, in an RDS file or and I believe on the Python side in a pickle file, you can pretty much store anything you want\r \r in those files, which is incredibly useful,\r \r when it comes to doing things like machine learning and and having to, you know, deploy\r \r a machine learning model. Right? You want don't wanna have to retrain that model,\r \r as part of your production process. You wanna\r \r train that model, store it as a some sort of single object that makes it very easy to make predictions, to load and make predictions against. And that's where a lot of the times we'll use RDS files\r \r or or pickle files on the Python side.\r \r\n\nBut, you know, I certainly share your sentiment that if nothing else\r \r this\r \r CVE\r \r brings to light, you know, the point that\r \r you need to trust the sources of your RDS or your pickle files,\r \r completely.\r \r And, you know, if someone I I thought of this this sort of use case here that I think I've seen before, you know, in, like, a GitHub gist, you're you're trying to solve a problem.\r \r You're you're diving deep into to GitHub and to Stack Overflow,\r \r places like that, and you finally, you know, see somebody who has a reproducible example\r \r with some code, but in order to run that code, right, they they've also attached a file. There could be a CSV,\r \r could be an RDS file, a pickle file, something like that. And you you need to have that file to be able to run their code. Right? They weren't able to create, like, a full reproducible example for for whatever reason just based out of code where they they sort of simulated that data. You they're providing you this file that you're going to need to run that gist or run that example.\r \r\n\nAnd\r \r maybe in the past,\r \r you know, depending\r \r on where that file was was located, depending\r \r on, you know, who the author is of that that gist. If it's a\r \r repository of someone, you know, well known that you trust, maybe it's in the Pandas project or the DeepLiar project and it's posted by, you know, somebody from somebody from Posit or or Wes McKinney or something like that,\r \r maybe you're you're likely to trust that file and to download it and run it against that code.\r \r But if it's,\r \r you know, that that gets into a very sticky situation. And I think\r \r it's just a good time maybe to remind your team in situations like that that they need to exercise extreme caution when opening and opening any file. Right? And and the the open source community,\r \r I think relies on a lot of trust\r \r for better or for worse. Right?\r \r\n\nAnd,\r \r you know, I guess this is just a good time for us to sort of step back\r \r and remember\r \r that,\r \r you know, there there could be bad actors out there and that we we have to deal with a lot of skepticism,\r \r in order to ensure the safety of the data products that we're creating and deploying to production.\r \r So, you know, like I said, if nothing else, you know, this is maybe a good time to to do that step back\r \r and to think twice. You know, admittedly,\r \r when this came out, you know, the the fact that that NIST, which I believe is, like, the government,\r \r entity, National Institute, Institute National Vulnerability Database is the NVD,\r \r place where this got posted to. And NIST is the big, you know, cybersecurity\r \r risk management,\r \r you government entity out there. So whenever you see something come across NIST,\r \r you know, and I'm thinking of, like, you know, a lot of the organizations\r \r constantly watching what NIST is publishing.\r \r\n\nSo if this came across their desk and, you know, NIST is sort of blasting this this new R vulnerability,\r \r It's something that we need to pay attention to and we need to engage in communication with those stakeholders to to really bring all sides of, you know, the the discussion to the table so that we can sort of understand, you know, exactly how this impacts us, what what's the messaging that needs to take place, What are any changes,\r \r if any, you know, that need to take place?\r \r And, you know, I think, again, sort of some of the the blog posts from from Bob's, sort of some of the blog posts here that we're we're reading from Ivan, you know, may just\r \r reiterate the the need that the the messaging, and the conversations, and the reinforcement of, you know, best security practices is is maybe more important here than actually making any changes to your R infrastructure.\r \r\n\nSo admittedly, you know, when I I did see this initial\r \r blog post come across from Hidden Layers\r \r and, you know, this new entry in the national vulnerability database\r \r come across,\r \r it was, you know, it was sort of big scary news a little bit. I put out a LinkedIn post, you know, talking about that we're we're sort of advising our clients to up to to our 4.4.0\r \r for new projects that they have and just to exercise that caution on RDS files or RDA files or any sort of, you know, pickle type file that, you know, you don't know exactly where it originated from. I I think those two pieces of advice are are still, you know, solid pieces of advice But in terms of, like, going backwards and and blowing up any processes that you had in place that maybe don't have anything to do with with the RDS or RDA files or something like that. I I don't think there's a need for that,\r \r at all. But obviously, a lot of opinions on this subject. I'm glad that we're getting a lot of opinions on this subject and folks are taking the time to really dig in here,\r \r but but this is sort of a a great blog post from Ivan to provide that perspective. It comes with a lot of links,\r \r a lot of citations, and I sincerely\r \r appreciate his work on this post.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:18:16] \r Eric Nantz"

        "trans_text": "Likewise. And, yeah, there's been there's been a a few others as well, and Bob's been quick to acknowledge others in his blog posts that have really been looking at these issues, you know, for a long term. But now ever since this came out, they were looking at even more. So Conrad Rudolph's another one. I call Davydov is another one if I'm saying it correctly. They've been on Mastodon looking at different proof proof of concepts of how this exploit\r \r could be utilized. But, again, the message is\r \r is that the language itself\r \r is still\r \r doing what it expected, that that it it hinges on this type of feature\r \r in terms of, you know, serializing\r \r data objects as efficient ways of transferring and whatnot.\r \r\n\nBut I do like your your callout about other formats that are taking shape in the community, such as parquet and the like.\r \r And with respect to putting on my life sciences hat for a second, there was questions I would get about,\r \r what does this mean in terms of if we use r for clinical submissions and whatnot?\r \r Well, guess what? It's very strict guidelines with respect to regulators that we transfer data\r \r in a very specific format that is not a serialized\r \r object. They have very rigorous\r \r procedures in place to eliminate\r \r the hint of any file being transferred that is, quote, unquote, executable in that sense. So we wouldn't even be bothering with these formats in a clinical submission as as of now.\r \r\n\nBut the other piece that I thought about, and I may mention this at the end of the episode, is I've been been working on a side project\r \r with a portal dashboard and GitHub actions that does\r \r duplication analysis\r \r but, and also a data quality check. But then I'm sending extracts\r \r of, like, each of the, quote, unquote, failed quality checks\r \r in 2 file formats, RDS\r \r and parquet.\r \r But the key point is that if someone is wants to inspect that themselves and maybe they are our user as well and they wanna see the RDS file for that particular step of, like, looking at duplicate\r \r IDs in a database or whatever.\r \r\n\n1st, they got a choice of which data format to pick from. But second,\r \r if they wanna see how I produce the RDS file, guess what? It's all in the open. Right? That's the nature of open source. I have all my my my GitHub action, our script,\r \r all in there that's run every week, and they can see for themselves\r \r what algorithm I'm using, how I'm serializing at the RDS,\r \r and, hence, transparency\r \r when it is available, I think, is paramount in these situations. So\r \r I think, you know, leaning on that but also leaning on the practical,\r \r you know, you know, practical, you know, thinking process, thought process\r \r of, you know, being critical about your data sources\r \r and then being transparent to your customers or your other colleagues about how this is being produced.\r \r\n\nI think that is being brought to the forthright\r \r foreflight here, so to speak.\r \r And I hope the discussion keeps going in this direction\r \r and not just tunnel vision on this very specific CVE itself because that's missing the point.\r \r This when we bring back the point to the general use of open source, the use of these serialized formats in general,\r \r again, nothing new in this ecosystem.\r \r It just so happens that it got popular enough that it became the light.

        "trans_text": "Well, Mike, let's lighten up the mood a little bit, shall we? Because, we're gonna we're gonna go back to school a little bit. But\r \r I hear there's a way we can even circumvent some of those hard math details in our next highlight here. And this is coming from Andrew Heiss who has been a frequent contributor\r \r to the our weekly highlights in in many episodes ago.\r \r And he has this great post on how you can take advantage of a method I've been utilizing in my day job for years,\r \r of simulation to help calculate probabilities where you might have had to rely on those,\r \r you know, famous or infamisimally or prospective math formulas\r \r that you might have seen in grad school. So what are we talking about here is that this is motivated by situations\r \r where maybe you're asked or you're teaching a concept\r \r that has to deal with some very, you know,\r \r intricate concepts and probability.\r \r\n\nI don't know about you, Mike, but I remember in my stats or math coursework,\r \r whenever you got the probability,\r \r you always were hit to that problem of you got, like, 1 or more of these urns of red, green, or yellow balls or whatever. Nice. And you gotta pick pick which what's the probability of getting, like, at least one of each color or 2 colors and not that one and whatnot.\r \r That's where Andrew in this post starts with, you know, a little refresher\r \r on how to use common\r \r metrics\r \r to represent\r \r the pool of choices from these balls and these earns\r \r and choose k, you would often call it. So the formulas are all there.\r \r\n\nYou I remember in the old days, I used the old TI 85 to calculate all this.\r \r Shout out to all the TI 85 nerds out there.\r \r We may or may not put games on it, but that's what I'm sorry for another day. But in any event,\r \r guess what? You can do this in r itself. There's the choose function. Right? There's choose, and you can say out of 40 balls, choose 5. What are the number of possibilities\r \r you can get there? And then, of course, you can do that for your answer. It gets a little more complicated when you get to more nuanced questions of\r \r maybe at least one red, blue, or green ball. Then you can see in the post here, there's lots of different\r \r combinations they have to sort through in your numerator and denominator.\r \r\n\nAnd, yes, you can use r for it, but, again, you've got you've got a lot going on there.\r \r Well, Andrew mentions way back in his training in 2012, he had a professor\r \r that kind of mentioned a comment at the end of one of his lectures\r \r that, you know what? You could get a similar answer as what you're doing in this math probability\r \r through simulation.\r \r And, of course, I'm sure if I had heard that at the time, I probably would have had that light bulb moment in my head too of like, hey. I wonder if I could circumvent some of this gnarly\r \r math formulation. And sure enough,\r \r you certainly can.\r \r\n\nSo Andrew\r \r dug up some old some of his historic r code. Again, credit to him for being transparent on this of a 4 loop that he created to simulate that earned problem of choosing\r \r at least one color probability of choosing at least one color out of that.\r \r And it's a pretty intuitive for loop. Right? You'll see it in the post, but when you read it, you grok what's happening there without the need of those fancy combination formulas.\r \r Now where does this mean practically? Well, he was inspired\r \r by a post he saw on Blue Sky\r \r of someone asking in their household.\r \r\n\nThey have an n o six. They have all their birthdays inside a 6 month interval.\r \r How likely or unlikely is that in practice?\r \r That's an interesting birthday problem, if I dare say so myself.\r \r So the rest of this post goes into all the different ways that we can address this.\r \r And one neat way to address this first\r \r is taking advantage of a unique\r \r geometric representation\r \r to see just how this shapes up in terms of how the months are related to each other.\r \r And he mentions creating a radial chart of sorts,\r \r taking advantage of a newer GEOME that's supposed to ggplot23.5.\r \r And there's code here in the blog post\r \r to do this.\r \r\n\nI believe it's called GM radio\r \r or if I recall correctly. Yep. Oh, cord radio. Yep.\r \r Yep.\r \r And there's some great visuals here,\r \r for his household\r \r where these birthdays fit birthday months fit in this spectrum. And if they're in a 6 month window, they're going to be all within\r \r a half circle radius of each other or half circle on the on the perimeter,\r \r if you will. My geometry is rusty, folks. Bear with me here. But it gets even more gnarly of that when you start thinking about,\r \r well, now let's try to generalize this a little bit. And what happens in the case where a birthday is from a previous year,\r \r but it's still within that 6 month window? How do you navigate representation on that?\r \r\n\nSo he's got some examples of how you do a clever use of additional segments to go from the previous year to the January 1st date of the new year and visualizing that. So there's great code in ggplot2\r \r that walked through how he is able to accomplish this visualization\r \r and how it handles birthdays outside that 6 month scope and wealth within it. And like I said, with years overlapping and whatnot,\r \r but that's just the visualization\r \r part. Now, the actual\r \r calculation of the probabilities at hand,\r \r this is where\r \r I've always said dates, times, time zones are hard. And this is another situation here because you can't quite get away with representing the birthdays\r \r on this perfect circle because\r \r in calendar years, we got different days a month. We got the leap year to deal with and whatnot.\r \r\n\nSo there's a lot of custom code that's needed\r \r to derive\r \r things like the distance between the the earliest date and the latest date,\r \r accounting for year transitions,\r \r trying to transform this into a pseudo circle representation.\r \r There's a lot of interesting code here that's doing a hybrid of, you know, per map reducing\r \r and arithmetic with respect to these birthday dates, sometimes having to multiply\r \r time spans by 2 and whatnot to make this happen.\r \r And then once you get through kind of the algorithm side of it,\r \r now you gotta actually perform the simulation.\r \r\n\nAnd, again, taking into account leap years and whatnot.\r \r So he does come up with a function that takes advantage of some of the algorithms he develops early in the post\r \r to start simulating this. And, again, at this first glance, from a uniform type setup,\r \r assuming all birthdays could be, you know, occurring equal on equal days in the calendar.\r \r On the surface, that seems like a a gen like a reasonable assumption.\r \r Actually, not so much.\r \r And this is where at the end of the post, he discovers that there are sources from the CD and the Social Security\r \r Administration here in\r \r the US that actually keeps track of daily births in the United States from in fact, in 538, that portal\r \r had a story in 2016 about the patterns in this. And guess what? They put their CSV files on GitHub that they use to assemble all this. So guess what?\r \r\n\nNow instead of assuming that it's a uniform distribution of these birthdays falling on any of the 365\r \r days of the year, we can actually sample from this known set\r \r of prior birthdays to get a more accurate representation\r \r of that distribution\r \r in in daily practice.\r \r He does this nice visualization\r \r of the kind of a heat map here\r \r showing that there are indeed\r \r portions of the calendar\r \r where birthdays are more common,\r \r such as, like, not many are current around Christmas and New Year's. Yeah. I wonder why, but that's an interesting thought exercise for everybody.\r \r But it it's right there. Yeah. You can see it's clearly not uniform.\r \r\n\nSo he's able to update his probability\r \r functions\r \r to utilize this type of distribution approach to sample from here.\r \r And then in the end, we get a nice little bar chart at the end or a lollipop chart, depending on how you wanna call it, where you look at, depending on the household size,\r \r the decrease in probability that all these birthdays occur\r \r in a 6 month window.\r \r To no surprise, when you have less number in the household, like 2 or 3,\r \r although, actually, 2, looks almost a 100%\r \r confident\r \r that you'll have birthdays that fall in the 6 month time span. But as you get the 3, 4,\r \r 5, 6, you start to see that kind of exponential decay, if you will,\r \r of seeing how unlikely it is to when you have a larger household, such as, like, 6.4%\r \r for an 8 person household.\r \r\n\nBut in the end,\r \r what is not in all the functions that he produced here to derive this answer?\r \r No call outs of probability formulas.\r \r No calls to that choose function.\r \r It is all based on a rigorous set of simulations.\r \r I admit there's a lot going on in this post here,\r \r but in the end, the approach is what I wanna take away from here is that when you're in doubt to find that maybe close form solution\r \r or that neat probabilistic,\r \r you\r \r know, derivation\r \r or formula calculation,\r \r simulation is your friend here. And with the computer technology we have and modern systems\r \r and whatnot.\r \r\n\nYou can get a great approximation\r \r to these answers even for fun problems like this birthday problem. So, again, felt like I was going to school here, but it was a great way to tie in multiple things that I do in the day to day. But explain in Andrew's a really great,\r \r\n\n[00:32:04] \r Mike Thomas"

And\r \r I\r \r too, Eric, like you,\r \r really wish that I had been taught probability and statistics,\r \r with the concepts of of simulation,\r \r instead of the more theoretical approach that I was taught with. I think my grades probably would have been a little bit higher in that class if that had been the case, but, you know, what can we do now? It eventually\r \r clicks fortunately,\r \r and I\r \r imagine that Andrew's\r \r students are probably pretty grateful\r \r of his very practical and applied\r \r approaches,\r \r to explaining and demonstrating concepts\r \r like this. I I too thought it was pretty interesting,\r \r the idea that, birthdays maybe\r \r are not sort of normally\r \r distributed.\r \r\n\nAlthough,\r \r it looks like the difference between his simulation when he made that assumption that birthdays are normally distributed across the year,\r \r versus, you know, when he went to using the data from 538.\r \r The differences there are are pretty marginal, you know, with his household size of of 6.\r \r You know, assuming that there was a uniform distribution of birthdays, I think his simulation returned like a a 17.8%\r \r chance of all 6 of those birthdays occurring within the same 6 month window.\r \r And when he used that 538 data to simulate from, the percentage actually jumped or the likelihood actually jumped from 17.8\r \r to 19.3.\r \r\n\nSo a a little bit higher probability with 6 folks in your household that they will all have a a birthday within sort of a same 6 month window. I I thought that was, you know, fairly interesting. And really, it's the\r \r approach here. It's the practicality.\r \r It's the the tools that he's giving us to to execute the same type of analysis that I think are super useful. So I would recommend that that anybody\r \r who is maybe, having a difficult time or or just needs a refresher\r \r on, you know, sort of basic probability and statistics\r \r via simulation,\r \r check out this blog post. It's fantastic\r \r top to bottom.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:34:38] \r Eric Nantz"

And I dare say it's also kind of a little gateway, if you will, to the concepts of Bayesian statistics as well with this idea of you may not know in real life what that distribution of outcomes or that set of data you're dealing with.\r \r When in doubt, you'll take what you do know,\r \r try to use that as prior information. Again, I'm using this on purpose, but these are things that again, when I was in school, I didn't know heads or tails about Bayesian probability. I was over in the Bayes theorem, which we just glossed over in 1 week, and then suddenly I'm off to the next convergence stuff.\r \r That is a fascinating\r \r world that we often\r \r dealing with with respect to the multitude of data sources we have.\r \r\n\nAnd it is very difficult to assume one type of specific recipe, if you will, for how these are being created in the real world. So simulations\r \r combined with Bayesian\r \r methodology,\r \r I think they put so much in the hands of you, the data scientist or statistician,\r \r to come up with meaningful answers\r \r in light of not knowing what is the real source of truth here. So, again, it's a great it's a great, you know, pseudo, you know, gateway to to that side of the world. And, yeah, I probably would have had a little better grades if I had something like Andrew as a professor, but we don't have that time machine yet, Mike. And, I dare say we ended up pretty well nonetheless, but, you know, hindsight is 2020.\r \r\n\n[00:36:02] \r Mike Thomas"

And trust me, as someone who's been on the other side organizing\r \r these type of events, it is always great\r \r to reflect back, and\r \r I think what they share is what I share as well.\r \r\n\nThe content that we saw at Shining Conf was absolutely amazing from top to bottom\r \r across many different spectrums of innovation on Shiny itself\r \r the respect to doing data for good, which is a track that was led by our good friend, John Harmon.\r \r And then our shiny life sciences track, I had the pleasure of leading that track and having a lot of great content as well\r \r and amongst much more about Shining and Enterprise as well.\r \r They first mentioned, you know, talk that we actually talked about in the highlights last week, the tailoring Shiny for modern users. There's a shout out here in the post about that.\r \r You gotta listen to last week's episode for our take on that particular talk.\r \r\n\nBut, also,\r \r one of the keynotes that gave a lot of attention there were a few keynotes, actually.\r \r But Joe Chang, of course, the CTO and author of Shiny himself,\r \r talked about the async interest session concurrency in Shiny with extended\r \r task. This has been in the works for a long time,\r \r but when the recording comes out, you'll definitely wanna watch this talk because\r \r if you've been down the promises train that was talked about years ago in one of the, Rstudio conf keynotes,\r \r You know that wasn't for the faint of heart. This is really trying to put async\r \r within Shiny apps in a much more accessible way to developers.\r \r\n\nAnd there's a lot to come in this space, I'm sure, as more teams adopt this.\r \r As well as, of course, the keynote that I was fortunate to recruit,\r \r George Stagg from from the Pasa team to talk about reproducibility\r \r of WebAssembly and WebR.\r \r And boy, oh, boy, there's some nuggets at the end of that talk. And when they come to fruition,\r \r oh, boy, the game is going to change in respect of reproducibility\r \r and package versions\r \r and the like. There's some big, big stuff happening in this space. So that was really fun to have charts talk about that as well. We're also fortunate to have Pedro Silva from Appsilog, give his keynote on the past and future are shiny\r \r and and so much more. And, apparently, there is an announcement that they're gonna have a new open source package in the works with respect to, I believe, something to do with Rhino.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:38:58] \r Mike Thomas"

Collins put together a fantastic issue, and we'll talk about some additional fines over the next couple of minutes here.\r \r I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna give a little plug to Collins organization, ThinkR, on their blog. They have a great blog post. If you ever felt a little intimidated or don't know where to start with\r \r after you find that awesome JavaScript library online, but yet you're not quite sure how to put that into your Shiny app, they have a great,\r \r example here about taking\r \r the Sweet Alert 2 JavaScript\r \r library and putting that into a Shiny application, which to no surprise is powered by Golem.\r \r\n\nSo this is a great, you know, compliment to what you might find in the existing, like,\r \r engineering production grade shiny apps book that I think R and Colin Fay have authored.\r \r If you want a kind of a quick take and you found that Sweet Alert 2 utility,\r \r how do you bundle the dependencies together? How do you inject that into your golem app manifest?\r \r And how do you build, you know, easy functions on the other side of things to call that JavaScript\r \r and passing the data back and forth.\r \r It can definitely be very helpful to see how this works in the day to day because\r \r in the end, you're probably if you're in the shiny space for more than a little\r \r bit, you're gonna be asked by a customer or maybe even yourself\r \r to bling it up a little bit, give a little more pizzazz with that awesome utility. And you're like, wait a minute. There's no package for that. What do I do? Well, this approach is a is a great way to call that out. And I didn't know there was a new Sweet Alert 2 library. I've been using Sweet Alert via Dean Nitelli's\r \r shiny alert package, so maybe I need to throw him a note to see if he's interested in something like this.

        "trans_text": "And, yes, we are here to talk about our latest issue. And let's see who was that curator. Oh, yeah. It was me before I got this bad cold. So luckily, I was able to knock out some\r \r awesome resources here.\r \r Really terrific stuff we're gonna be talking about today.\r \r And as always, I have tremendous help from my fellow curators and contributors like all of you around the world. I will be honest. There weren't any poll requests this time, but luckily, many of you have submitted your websites to rweekly.org,\r \r so you're able to grab that content dynamically and put it into this issue.\r \r\n\nSo without further ado, here we go with a very important\r \r highlight to start with because\r \r version r4.4.0,\r \r codenamed puppy cup, has been released as of last week. And as always, it's always a big event whenever a new version of r has been released, and\r \r a great summary of the big\r \r changes has been put together\r \r by Russ Hyde, who is a data scientist at Jumping Rivers. And Russ leads off this post on the latest updates of 4.40 with a very\r \r interesting example\r \r on a concept that I don't take as much advantage of, although it can be very important, especially in situations where you don't quite know\r \r how to get to the right answer, so to speak.\r \r\n\nAnd this example is, of course, based on recursion.\r \r And, again, this is a paradigm often used when we're trying to get a close approximation\r \r to a type of solution.\r \r But, again, the path to that made me unclear, so to speak. So we may have to\r \r approximate running a function over and over again\r \r and then maybe build some either stopping rules or other criteria to say,\r \r how close are we? Are we close enough?\r \r And the example in the post that Russ puts in here is having to do a finding zeros in a mathematical function, such as, like, the sine curve and whatnot.\r \r He has a nice example of, like, if you're gonna build this function from scratch, how you might how you might approach it. He is quick to mention that there is a a built in function in R that would be better for this, but he calls this a bisect function\r \r and it's got some mathematical operations under the hood. But at the end, you'll notice\r \r it calls BISECT again right at the end of the code. So\r \r this is gonna keep running until\r \r it hits the right criteria\r \r for, say, getting that answer\r \r in a tolerance limit. Now beforehand,\r \r you might not know how many times this is gonna have to be called. You hope it's not very much, but it could be it's gonna be called quite a bit,\r \r perhaps 1,000\r \r or even 1,000,000 of times.\r \r\n\nAnd what happens when that happens?\r \r You fall victim\r \r to a Stack Overflow error.\r \r And there's probably a generation of listeners on this show who may think a Stack Overflow is a website to get programming help, but this is actually a CS term\r \r when you have these function results that are built on top of this stack,\r \r usually based in c or whatnot.\r \r But in r, you may have encountered this unwillingly if you accidentally put recursion in your paradigm, and it just ends up blowing up the stack, and then r will literally crash saying, you know what? I got too much in this stack. I don't know what to do with myself kinda thing.\r \r In version 440 of r, there is now a new function called tail call,\r \r which is gonna be basically a drop in replacement for that last call to your function at the end of the original function\r \r where instead of, like, doing, in this case, the bisect call again at the end, you're gonna put bisect\r \r into this tail call function.\r \r\n\nThe motivation for this is that r is only going to keep track of that last call that ended up knee being necessary for the solution\r \r instead of all those intermediate calls beforehand. Hence,\r \r you could have a recursive function ends up being used, say, 1,000,000 of times,\r \r but that call stack is only gonna retain what it needed at the end, so to speak.\r \r Now I admit, I don't do recursion very much, but I can definitely see how useful this will be in situations\r \r where you're probably gonna need some additional iterations\r \r before you get to that elegant solution that you're trying to solve.\r \r\n\nSo they do mention it is experimental because this is a brand new function, so, hopefully,\r \r it'll work well for your use cases and recursion.\r \r But certainly a welcome feature for those of you in the approximation realm.\r \r And I deal with this a lot in simulations as well, so that will be a very\r \r nice usability enhancement for my recursion workflows.\r \r But of course, there is much more here, too.\r \r And also new to R is the introduction of a nice and elegant way\r \r to deal with those null values and conditionals. And, Mike, why don't you tell us about that? Yeah. This is something that's been in Arling for quite a while now,\r \r\n\n[00:06:33] \r Mike Thomas"

        "trans_text": "that I've seen,\r \r you know, in a lot of source code that I've taken a look at online but maybe not realized,\r \r and and haven't used it myself\r \r either and and not realized that it's not in base r. So it's this\r \r operator and if you want to write it, it is 4 characters,\r \r percent sign,\r \r pipe pipe percent sign.\r \r And essentially\r \r what it does is it evaluates the left hand side\r \r of that pipe\r \r and it says if that left hand side is null\r \r return what's on the right hand right hand side of the pipe. So it's it's a sort of a shorthand for is dot null,\r \r essentially for evaluating maybe conditional,\r \r if statements, flow control type statements, and just making, your code a little bit more concise that you don't have to write out that full is null, you know, else statement if you want. So\r \r especially if if you're someone maybe developing in our package or something like that where you are trying to test to see if a particular element is null and if it is, you want to return maybe a message or a different object or something like that just because you're trying to program defensively, which is something that we all try to do,\r \r in all of our work, I think this this shorthand operator could potentially\r \r be your friend there and may reduce the need to import Arlang, although I haven't written an R package where I don't have to bring in our where I haven't brought in Arlang in quite a long time.\r \r\n\nBut maybe it'll still be useful, you know, in your local scripts if if you don't need Arlang as well and you just wanna have this particular operator handy. So very excited to see this operator come into Besar.\r \r I think it's,\r \r I think it's a good\r \r a good decision by the ArcCorp team. I know it's probably not a trivial thing to add, you know, an operator\r \r to base r, and that's probably, actually a fairly big decision at the end of the day. But I believe that its use is is so widespread probably at this point that it makes sense for them to have done that. So that's a a nice little inclusion that we have in our 4 dot 4. One additional\r \r thing that is introduced as well is this new shorthand hexadecimal\r \r format, which I guess is common in in web programming. And and you can think about, you know, specifying\r \r your your hex codes for your colors. Right? Maybe in your ggplots or something like that. And most of the time, if we're we're trying to specify a particular hex code, we have to write it out all 6 digits out, you know, except maybe in the case of,\r \r some hex code that has a repeating pattern, you know. I think of black and white. It's just f f f and and 0.\r \r\n\nRight? Sometimes you don't need to write those\r \r all the way out. But, I guess the the shorthand\r \r allows you\r \r to translate a code like 112233\r \r to just,\r \r you know, pound sign 123 or hashtag 123 for the kids out there.\r \r So it's interesting,\r \r that that we now have this shorthand textadecimal format.\r \r There's some additional,\r \r improvements around parsing and formatting complex numbers if you're someone that leverages complex numbers in your R code,\r \r I can't say that that I'm one as well. And then probably the the last one which may be\r \r arguably the most useful\r \r is this new sort by function,\r \r sort underscore by. And it allows you to essentially sort a data frame typically based upon 1 or more columns,\r \r that you could specify in a list if you have multiple columns or you can just provide that one column to the sort by function.\r \r\n\nAnd,\r \r you know, I I think it's it's really interesting that we have that now. It's it's going to make,\r \r everybody's life easier to to sort of data frame in base r,\r \r\n\n[00:10:18] \r Eric Nantz"

So Russ links, and we'll put a link in this as well to the full news file of the the all the updated changes.\r \r And he also concludes we're we're just talking about containers earlier, Mike. A great way for you to try r 44, if you don't wanna put it on your system right away,\r \r is to leverage Docker containers.\r \r Then he's got a simple example of pulling that,\r \r into into your system,\r \r and it's very easy to do, 2 lines in in each of those cases.\r \r And you may wanna look at this sooner or later because\r \r I you you can't write this you can't script this, so to speak, but literally the morning after I released our weekly,\r \r this updated issue,\r \r A news item that's been making the waves, and we'll probably have a lot more to say possibly next week on, is that for possibly the first time ever, there has been a critical vulnerability\r \r exploit discovered for the r language\r \r with respect to potential malicious\r \r code that could be inserted into what's called the RDS file format, which for those that aren't familiar, is a way for you to serialize\r \r our objects into a binary type format that's tailored to what R can use to import and export.\r \r\n\nNow there's a lot you know, I think there's a lot of information that's still going to be shared, without throughout the community on this.\r \r But if you're in an organization or you help consult with an organization,\r \r it may be worth informing them about this in case they wanna update their r version of 44\r \r now that that's been released. And that's important because r44\r \r event has been set to fix this vulnerability.\r \r So it would only be previous versions of r that could be potentially vulnerable to this.\r \r Like I said, I imagine we'll have more to say about this in the coming weeks because there's still a lot to digest here, but that is something for awareness. If you were you're on the fence about updating, that might, push you onto that edge sooner than later.\r \r\n\n[00:12:20] \r Mike Thomas"

        "trans_text": "And for our last couple highlights here, we're gonna visit our friendly, old Shiny Corner here because we got 2 terrific highlights having to do with Shiny itself that we'll touch on here.\r \r And actually, both of these are fresh off\r \r some presentations that were shared at the recent Appsilon Shiny conference. So lots of momentum from that. And first, we're going to dive into\r \r a very nice kind of usability\r \r enhancement for you as you bootstrap these Shiny apps and you want to take advantage of the latest and greatest\r \r best practices.\r \r\n\nAnd in particular, we're going to talk about a post by Garrick Aiden-Buie, who is a software engineer on the Shiny team at Posit.\r \r And he mentions in this post that a big initial focus in his 1st year with the team\r \r has been, you know, enhancing the bslib package,\r \r which Mike and I have been singing the praises of for over a year now, I believe, of this package. But for those that aren't aware,\r \r bslib kinda started off as a way to bring in the modern bootstrap styling into your Shiny apps without it affecting the Shiny core package itself. So this is an additional package that you'll load with your Shiny apps. And with it came some really nice new\r \r takes on layout functions, such as page sidebar and other,\r \r layouts that are very well tailored for dashboards and much more, as he\r \r says. Well, it's one thing to be a SLIB out there. It's one thing to have these examples out in the community, you know, say, with the package vignettes, the package website, and whatnot.\r \r\n\nBut there has always been a feature that many have taken advantage of in their development environments to quickly get Shiny apps up and running with a traditional sidebar layout, and that's the use of snippets.\r \r So in in RStudio Workbench or RStudio IDE, for example,\r \r there are a handful of built in snippets,\r \r including one to get a Shiny app off the ground.\r \r But you'll notice\r \r that this Shiny app is using the traditional Shiny package itself with its sidebar functions.\r \r And what Garrick does in this post is shows you how to quickly update that to take advantage of bslibs\r \r page sidebar\r \r layout so that you can get started right away with using bslib in your app. And it is super helpful, especially if you're going to be building these\r \r on a routine basis\r \r and you want to be able to not have to refactor your code after you get that initial snippet off the ground and say, oh, wait. No. I I wanna pivot the BS flips thing for this. So great. Yeah. Now you can have this\r \r snippet added in your Rstudio or update your snippet, I should say, in your Rstudio IDE's available snippets.\r \r\n\nBut there is more.\r \r This was an intriguing thing I've seen from somebody at Pasa themselves\r \r is that he also calls out a simple way for you to update or add a new snippet\r \r in your Versus Code snippets as well, which I know has been used heavily in a lot of Shiny app development these days. We in fact, at the recent Appsilon Shiny conference, we had a lot of people spreading enthusiasm\r \r about using Versus Code for more complicated setups. So Garrick has an example at this post\r \r of how you can add this snippet that looks very similar\r \r to the one that you would add in our studio's\r \r snippets feature,\r \r just a little bit more quoting around it. And let's say JSON, you know, syntax. But once you have it, then you can get that same functionality in in Rstudio or Versus Code. So take your pick. You're gonna have a nice snippet that you can use to get yourself started with BS Lib right away, right on the right foot.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:16:57] \r Mike Thomas"

        "trans_text": "Yeah, Eric. That's a great find, and\r \r snippets are something that I feel like I was very late to the game taking advantage of. But nowadays,\r \r you know, especially when I'm creating, like, small reprexes\r \r or examples or stuff like that for clients, you know, the the little Shiny app snippet that I get in R Studio is so much faster. It probably saves me a minute or 2 of actually creating that that UI in that server and loading\r \r Shiny at the header. So this is fan and I haven't really explored the concept of, like, creating your own snippets, but this is just a really nice simple walk through by Garrick on on how you could go about doing this in either RStudio\r \r or Versus Code. So it's definitely something that I need to start taking advantage of a little bit more because it is such a time saver. It's such a no brainer.\r \r\n\nAnd as Garrick sort of outlines in this post here, it's easy. It's it's not difficult at all to get up and running with. So,\r \r fantastic\r \r walkthrough by Garrick. And, you know, just like you, Eric, I am all bslib all the time when it comes to Shiny apps these days. So having some shorthand that actually\r \r sort of skeletons out the bslib app as opposed to having to edit what gets returned from the old Shiny app snippet,\r \r to conform to a bslib type structure\r \r is just going to additionally save that amount of time and and make my workflows more efficient.\r \r\n\n[00:18:20] \r Eric Nantz"

In particular, I've always been a big fan of the ones such as picker input from Shiny Widgets, for example. I should have a snippet just to get one of those off the ground very quickly. I mean, there's you could take this to many different levels. But, yeah, anything to save you time to get this off the right way and then kind of reducing that manual effort of maybe just copy and pasting that snip that thing from one app to another.

But they co presented\r \r a presentation called Tailoring Shiny for Modern Users.\r \r\n\nAnd the motivation for this was in this organization,\r \r as ASDOS,\r \r they have, which stands for Association of State and Territorial Health Officials,\r \r they usually they conduct on a regular basis a longitudinal type census\r \r every 3 years, and they started this back in 2007\r \r to help get some information with respect to potential funding and other projects\r \r that are happening at the state level for these different agencies.\r \r The results of these are very instrumental, apparently, for monitoring trends,\r \r advocating for additional funding,\r \r informing their future strategies, and much more.\r \r\n\nSo lots of data to deal with. And, of course, what's a good way to deal with these data? Let's throw this into\r \r a dashboard for end users to review.\r \r And the previous generation of this dashboard was built with Tableau where everything was in\r \r a kinda one interface layout,\r \r And certainly it looked functional. I never used it, but it definitely looked functional.\r \r But everything, like I said, is in kind of the single view\r \r and may or may not leave a little bit to be desired.\r \r Well, fast forward to the way they approach refactoring this with usability in mind and design in mind. So they took a step back\r \r and they modernized the user interface approach with this, I'll call, 3 column type layout,\r \r Where on the left, they've organized the inputs and not just, like, throwing all the inputs top to bottom\r \r in a a huge sidebar they have to scroll down on to actually see everything.\r \r\n\nThey've sub you know, they kinda compartmentalize\r \r these in different unique tabs at the top\r \r to get you focused on a few key inputs at a time and be able to click through these,\r \r different, like, tabs or organization\r \r so it's not overwhelming you right away.\r \r And then in the middle is like the main content. In this case, it's a lot of interactive\r \r additional context for that result. Maybe it's links to additional information or other\r \r information that would be useful as you're reviewing those visual\r \r results.\r \r And they have this kind of unified approach for the different tabs representing different analysis,\r \r you know, results\r \r all within the same application.\r \r\n\nBut, Mike, I when you look at this, there is almost no way you can tell this is a shiny f. This just looks absolutely fantastic.\r \r And on top of that, they even looked at accessibility\r \r as a first class citizen, so to speak, and how they built the colors of this as well. There's just so much going on here. It's just amazing stuff.\r \r\n\n[00:22:47] \r Mike Thomas"

        "trans_text": "This is one of the best\r \r designed,\r \r like, websites in general, you know, information\r \r based\r \r websites, dashboards, whatever you wanna call it\r \r that I've ever seen, shiny or not.\r \r It's it's so clean. It's so thorough. It's incredibly thorough. You know, just some of the concepts that get employed here around displaying\r \r information and and trying to minimize clutter, you know, when there's sort of long\r \r explanations they cut it off after after 4 lines with an ellipse but have a hyperlink to to read more where that will open up, you know, sort of a longer form screen to to read more context\r \r on that text. They have definitions which are, you know, expandable,\r \r and nicely collapsed. Like you said, these these Highcharts driven charts are are beautifully\r \r tool tipped on top that that have a really nice,\r \r really nice encapsulation of all the information that they're trying to display. One of the coolest things for me, Eric, that we talked about preshow a little bit was on some of these, charts pages,\r \r you know, they allow you to sort of add filters\r \r dynamically where you can, you know, click a single button that says add a filter,\r \r you select, I believe, the column that you want to use for filtering and then you select the different,\r \r value or values,\r \r within that column that you want to filter down the data to and and that, you know, results in filtering the information that gets displayed\r \r in the chart. But instead of having, you know, a bunch of different filters\r \r on screen already\r \r across all the different columns that are probably\r \r represented in the underlying dataset,\r \r that would probably clutter the screen\r \r with the idea that maybe the user only wants to to leverage 1 or 2 columns for filtering context.\r \r\n\nYou know, don't\r \r create that clutter right off the bat and allow the user to select\r \r as many filters\r \r as they want. It's a few extra clicks, but I think I'm sure that they paid a lot of attention to user experience and really got to know the audience that's gonna be using this this app and understand that, you know, maybe they're only using a couple filters,\r \r and and maybe it's it's certainly gonna change from user to user,\r \r then it would make sense to to go with that approach. But, again, you know, that approach just makes everything super clean\r \r on screen and it\r \r I'm still blown away. I think I'm probably gonna it's gonna be very difficult for me to navigate away from this app today and actually start doing my work,\r \r as opposed to just playing in here,\r \r and desperately, you know, begging John and Lindsay for the source code behind this app.\r \r\n\nBut,\r \r it's it's one of the most\r \r beautiful apps I've I've ever seen. So I'm very grateful that they, you know, at least shared this app with us. I I think if nothing else, you know, and we don't get access to the source code or anything like that, the design ideas behind this are are just\r \r fantastic.\r \r And as I told you earlier, Eric, it just makes me want\r \r to go into all of our Shiny app projects and just immediately\r \r refactor them and bring in some of these principles because\r \r I feel like our work is light years away from what they've put together here. It is the the best way that I can describe it is just so clean.\r \r\n\n[00:26:02] \r Eric Nantz"

I'm gonna throw it on there. I'm gonna throw it on this other side. I'm gonna throw it on this footer. Like, it it will just drive you nuts. And, yes, I have seen many dashboards that were built with Shiny or things like Power BI\r \r that just become so cluttered\r \r with everything in your face, so to speak.\r \r\n\nThis, the organization at the top nav bar, but then within these sidebars,\r \r not overwhelming us of all the inputs at once. I mean, these are it is just it takes so\r \r it it just means that if you pay attention to detail on this early on, I mean, you're just gonna set you up for so much success for a wider range of customers or audience for your app\r \r and really taking advantage of these modern principles.\r \r Are quite overwhelming.\r \r Even though they're meant for statisticians, I don't think a statistician should have to suffer, so to speak, from information overload. So there are definitely\r \r techniques from here I wanna take into my production apps. Now the one thing they have open sourced,\r \r is this concept of what they call the data stories feature, where in the app itself,\r \r you will see this gallery of these different kinda more long form articles,\r \r but they're very nicely organized,\r \r kinda like a scrolly teletype setup a little bit. But then as you scroll,\r \r you get this nice interspersed set of narrative\r \r with the aforementioned visualizations\r \r and really a great way to kind of break apart visually, so to speak, these different sections. So there is an example repo for that that we will link to in the show notes if you wanna take advantage of that feature in your development. But, yeah, I'm gonna have to fight the urge to refactor all my apps now. But I do think I will refactor some of my apps. Just kidding.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:28:01] \r Mike Thomas"

We're hopefully be able to dive into a lot of the technical bits on this in the future because I think it's a excellent story to tell, not just the the journey to get here to these principles, but actually how she pulled it off. So\r \r stay tuned for that. I don't know when yet, but you will know when when it's ready for that.\r \r But there's a lot more to stay tuned for because the rest of the Wiki issue has a boatload of additional resources,\r \r whether it's new tutorials,\r \r new packages, and updated packages. And I dare say this might be my biggest\r \r package section update yet because I got a lot to choose from here and a lot of great innovations across all different areas of of our and we'll take a couple of minutes for our additional finds in this in this segment like we always do.\r \r\n\nI've been, you know, a very big proponent, especially on my interactions of HPC systems,\r \r being on the command line, so to speak, you know, getting down and dirty with my data, quick inspections, you know, like Ed or tail of the last few rows.\r \r And I've I've been, you know, very enamored by some of these tools in the Linux community\r \r that let you profile performance of your system. There's something called HTOP\r \r and VTOP, etcetera. You can see, like, in real time\r \r your system performance and these nice line charts and stuff.\r \r Well, if you want that similar situation with R,\r \r guess what? There is a brand new pack that's released to CRAN\r \r called plot CLI,\r \r which has been authored by Klasheuer.\r \r\n\nHopefully, I'm saying that right. And like I said, it just hit CRAN recently.\r \r And this is going to take\r \r a very\r \r traditional type ggplot\r \r and convert it to a special object that you can print in the terminal and get nice coloring and symbol representation,\r \r which if you can't get to, like, say, a POSIT or RStudio IDE or a Versus Code instance,\r \r this might be a great thing to do if you're on that lower level, so to speak, with that HPC system\r \r and wanna look at a quick visualization.\r \r So I'm really excited about that.\r \r And, Mike, what did you wanna talk about?

He worked at Vienna University of Technology,\r \r and then moved to the University of Munich. I was a professor in computational statistics\r \r and became the head of that department actually\r \r in 2010 before moving back to to Vienna in in 2011 to to to work at the University of Natural Resources\r \r and Life Sciences.\r \r\n\nSo a very impressive career. One of his also additional contributions, I mean, this this almost sounds\r \r sounds made up, is that he actually developed the sWeave system that allows you to combine our and LaTeX\r \r into a single document which obviously is sort of, you know, the the core engine and how the Knitter project sort of came about and was built on top of, and now we have quarto sort of on top of that. So and I'm imagining that that also predates things like Jupyter Notebooks.\r \r So that idea\r \r of, you know, creating sort of reproducible\r \r research that encompasses both\r \r your your code and your narrative and your figures and your tables and your output like that,\r \r is is largely, I have to imagine, due to Fritz's work which is incredible.\r \r\n\nYou know, they also note that\r \r that led to, you know, the ability to create our package vignettes\r \r which obviously is something that's super powerful, I think, in the our ecosystem because it provides us with a way to give end users\r \r documentation\r \r that is does not necessarily exist or is not as thorough,\r \r or or beautiful, in my opinion, as what some other languages offer in terms of documentation around their packages.\r \r So, you know, he they say that in his, professorship, he he taught generations of of students,\r \r at bachelor, master, and PhD level,\r \r introduced\r \r 100\r \r of, R users to to proper R development\r \r workflows,\r \r and he is going to be extremely missed by the our core team and the our community,\r \r and we're incredibly grateful for his contributions\r \r to the our ecosystem\r \r and really allowing us what allowing us the ability to do what we do on a daily basis.

        "trans_text": "Game 1, they did, but it was a tough one last night. Oh, I missed it. Yeah. Well They fell last night? Yeah. There was a there was a one goal difference. But,\r \r Boston and Toronto, they don't like each other, and this is probably gonna go the distance if I had to guess. So buckle your seatbelts wherever you are.\r \r But, of course, you had to bring that up.\r \r My beloved wings\r \r lost on a silly tiebreaker to not make the playoffs. So I'm still wincing from that. But, nonetheless,\r \r we're not gonna we're not gonna, you know, complain too much here because we got some fun rweekly content to talk to you about today, and this issue has been curated by Jonathan Carroll, now one of our long time contributors\r \r to the rweekly project. And as always, yeah, tremendous help from our fellow rweekly team members and contributors like all of you around the world with your poll requests and suggestions.\r \r\n\nAnd we lead off with a visit to our visualization corner once again,\r \r and we're gonna talk about what is a very common and fundamental\r \r visualization that we often see in genetic and biomarker analyses\r \r and give it a little interactivity boost to make the experience even better for your collaborators.\r \r And this post comes to us from Thomas Sandman, who is a computational biologist.\r \r And he leads off with this situation where he wanted to share\r \r a very,\r \r powerful visualization\r \r called volcano plots to a collaborator.\r \r Now, what is a volcano plot, you might ask? Well, this is the plot where you can look at if you're comparing, say, 2 different groups in your experiment or your design.\r \r\n\nMaybe it's, in the case of life sciences, it might be a treated set of patients versus a controlled set of patients.\r \r And with these biomarkers, you are measuring\r \r boatloads of genetic quantities such as gene expression\r \r for their genetic microarrays, you might call it. And then you're gonna do some inferences on these. But you're often gonna have\r \r 1,000 upon 1,000 of these genetic markers.\r \r So you don't really know, you know, right away which one of these is gonna show a, you know, positive or negative trend either way.\r \r So the volcano plot's job is on the y axis. You will see\r \r often a log adjusted p value of the inference method.\r \r\n\nAnd then on the x axis, you'll see the fold change of the gene expression, which is like a ratio\r \r of the gene expression values from 1 group over the other.\r \r And, again, the shape, as you see, this does look literally like a volcano erupting on each side. It's a very, very intriguing visualization.\r \r I remember being blown away about that many years ago in my previous life as a statistician\r \r analyzing gene expression data.\r \r But, nonetheless, you can create these, as you can guess in R, quite, quite efficiently with the, always,\r \r you know, ready at your at your visualization hip here of ggplot2.\r \r\n\nAnd he has a great example\r \r after downloading some, gene expression data\r \r to do this volcano plot where you see, as I mentioned on the y axis, the log transform\r \r p values. And on the x axis, the fold change, also log transform.\r \r And he colors it by the different groups in the experiments. And you can see above a certain threshold,\r \r the red dots with\r \r the the gene expression fold change going in the positive direction\r \r versus the blue dots going in negative direction.\r \r Now that's great, but what if your collaborator or yourself wants to get more information\r \r on individual points in this?\r \r\n\nThat's where interactivity\r \r comes to play. In particular,\r \r you can opt into interactivity\r \r quite efficiently\r \r with the g\r \r g I raf or g giraffe, depending on your pronunciation\r \r of it. That package\r \r has been mentioned quite a few times on the highlights over the years. That package is authored by David Goel, who is also the architect of the Office verse,\r \r family of packages that we often see in our enterprise work. But ggiraffe,\r \r the way that works is that all you have to really do is replace the geom point in your red regular ggplot2call\r \r with the geom point interactive\r \r function.\r \r\n\nAnd with this, you supply a tooltip\r \r where when the user hovers over a point, you can supply metadata,\r \r if you will, on that particular point. And in the case of this plot,\r \r Thomas is supplying\r \r the p value,\r \r the log fold change,\r \r and the gene name itself. So, again, you can quickly see as you hover over that plot right in the blog post\r \r each of these, you know, specific genes and their fold change and p values.\r \r Now that's pretty good in and of itself. That might get you all the way there.\r \r But this is where this gets pretty intriguing, actually, because what if this plot\r \r is gonna be part of a larger report? I remember making these reports routinely with our markdown or even the predecessor to that s sweep in the in the early days.\r \r\n\nBut these plots, when you add these interactive elements,\r \r can take up a bit of size in terms of the\r \r HTML\r \r that's used to produce these plots when you add these tooltips in.\r \r So this comes now the very clever part of this post\r \r where Thomas is combining g g I f or something else\r \r and making the plot even more efficient for these reports. What what kind of trick has he done here? This this is pretty interesting where he combines the gg raster package with the ggiraffe\r \r\n\n[00:06:20] \r Mike Thomas"

        "trans_text": "package, and, you know, essentially, what he's able to do here\r \r is to leverage this function called GeonpointRAST,\r \r to actually initially plot the points\r \r on the chart that you will see, but those points are not interactive. It's this,\r \r raster rasterized image which does not encode the position\r \r of each point separately. So it's sort of less overhead on the page in and of itself. And then on top of that,\r \r he overlays\r \r transparent\r \r interactive points for the significant,\r \r genes.\r \r And you could see that's where he leverages the Geon Point interactive function,\r \r but the the the alpha there is set to 0 such that there's no color.\r \r\n\nYou can't actually tell\r \r that those points are plotted unless you are hovering over them. So it's a very clever way to, I think, reduce the overhead\r \r on the page. And the use case here would be particularly\r \r if you, had a lot of plots on the same HTML page and it was, you know, slow maybe for users or, you know, the tooltip wasn't responsive because, you know, there's a lot of overhead potentially on those pages. So I thought this was super super clever. I see some use of,\r \r the poor man package to do some filtering,\r \r which is interesting as well to only show tool tips\r \r for the points that meet a certain significant\r \r threshold,\r \r which is really interesting. So sort of the grayed out portion of the bottom of the graph, you're not gonna get tool tooltips for,\r \r because, you know, the idea would be that users only necessarily care about those that are at or above the level of significance.\r \r\n\nSo a really really clever use case here for doing that. I think the code is very familiar to those who have experienced\r \r with ggplot. It's it's really not a very big step to go from ggplot to the ggiraffe\r \r package. And this gg raster package is one that I had not necessarily leveraged before but, it's very very very interesting to me and very,\r \r I don't know, kind of incredible how well these two packages work together, the gg raster package and the ggiraffe\r \r package,\r \r for being able to essentially, you know, plot\r \r the the points visually, sort of, in a static way on the page and then adding the interactivity,\r \r in a way that, you know, does not duplicate,\r \r the effort. So,\r \r great, great blog post top to bottom. I think for those either in the, you know, just interested in data visualization, I don't think you necessarily have to have the background in life sciences.\r \r\n\nI certainly, you know, am not super well versed in in gene expression data or anything like that, but I still took a lot out of this blog post. So a great job by by Thomas and, great start to the highlights this week. Yeah. It's a really clever way of inter of, blending in these different elements, and it's also underscoring,\r \r\n\n[00:09:16] \r Eric Nantz"

Let's keep it positive.\r \r And coming now speaking of, you know, efficiencies that we can gain with our code in general, our next highlight here has a very interesting take on how they're approaching modularity and their codevelopment\r \r across different projects\r \r and within the same project.\r \r This next post here comes from Owen Jones, who is a data science engineer\r \r at the UK Health Security Agency.\r \r And this post is all about how his team\r \r has been leveraging\r \r the box package\r \r as an alternative to other means and r of\r \r distributing and hosting reusable code,\r \r code bundles,\r \r modules, whatever you wanna call them, and to gain efficiencies in their projects.\r \r\n\nSo he mentions at the top that, you know,\r \r warms my heart to see a team that's using R for almost all of their data analysis\r \r and processing needs. And they definitely recognize a point where,\r \r hey. This project is doing this thing. This other project is doing the similar thing.\r \r Let's be efficient. Let's reuse that code and not duplicate it every time on the same project. So they're already on the right track from a cognitive standpoint,\r \r hopefully,\r \r beyond the path of minimizing technical debt and also enhancing collaboration.\r \r Now, if you're listening to the show and you've been in the art community for even just a little bit, you're probably thinking or even screaming at your, you know, podcast audio right now saying,\r \r this sounds like a package, and I would definitely agree with you. I think packages are\r \r a wonderful way to distribute shared\r \r functionality\r \r of\r \r data processing\r \r or other operational there is a bit of additional, you know, overhead or skill set that there is a bit of additional,\r \r you know, overhead or skill set that you need to be effective with packages. And, plus,\r \r if you have an update to make, you gotta update that package and then reinstall it or redistribute\r \r it amongst your different teams. These are all valid points. I definitely acknowledge it takes some discipline when you're in the the package mindset.\r \r\n\nNow their approach, again, this is where things get interesting is they are leveraging the box package.\r \r And you may have heard of box more recently because box is actually a fundamental piece\r \r behind the Appsilon team's Rhino package for, building,\r \r Shiny apps in an enterprise fashion.\r \r Now Box\r \r and this is where Eric's gonna have some takes here. Mike might have some takes on this too.\r \r I think they take some getting used to just like our packages would just in different ways. But I will say, if you are familiar with Python, especially,\r \r your box is gonna seem pretty familiar to you because in Python, you're probably used to, at the top of your Python script,\r \r importing, say, all the functions from a given, you know, package, whatever you wanna call it, or importing specific functions,\r \r possibly even renaming them\r \r and being very explicit of what your global environment in that Python session is going to have from these modules. Well, Box basically gives the same thing in the context of our code. You'll have this preamble at the top of your script saying which\r \r function,\r \r which piece do you wanna use from another script.\r \r\n\nThat, hence, you know, be very tailored, so to speak, of what's going into\r \r your environment.\r \r I will admit that's still not, like, comfortable to me yet, but I can see\r \r that perspective for sure.\r \r And what,\r \r what, Peter\r \r oh, no. Shit. What Owen has done in his post is also talk about how they're organizing\r \r the way they use these modules.\r \r He defines 3 different types of these modules within the box framework. 1 is a general bucket. This is the stuff that's gonna be used across different projects.\r \r He cites connections to an AWS Redshift data warehouse.\r \r That makes complete sense to me. Having those be able to reuse\r \r across different projects.\r \r\n\nAnd then within a project, they'll have a specific set of modules, and they call them project modules. Put them in a specific subdirectory\r \r that will be, you know, as the name says, specific to that particular project.\r \r And then lastly,\r \r a section called local modules.\r \r This category is meant for, you know, kind of tying it all together in that specific project, maybe more for utility purposes\r \r and whatnot.\r \r Now with Box, the other interesting piece of this is that\r \r much like in the our session,\r \r when you, say, call library dplyr, for example, it is\r \r searching for where dplyr is installed via what's called the library path.\r \r\n\nAnd that's where you typically can see what these are in your R session when you do the dotlibpaths,\r \r function call.\r \r Box has a similar mechanism where you can define the box path,\r \r which is can be 1 or more paths to where these\r \r scripts that are containing these box modules are stored. That can also be set for an environment variable.\r \r In that case, they kind of do some custom manipulations of that for a given project via the dotrprofilefile,\r \r which again, this is where either at a project level or your main R session level,\r \r you can add code that will be run at startup automatically when you launch your r session.\r \r\n\nSo they're putting these box configurations\r \r in a dot r profile file, which is similar\r \r to what, say, the RM package does to tell\r \r our hey. Don't look at the default library path. Look at this RM specific library path for packages. So I did find it interesting that they're using that technique to customize the box set. And then the other little interesting bit here is that I mentioned they have a category for these general\r \r box modules that they'll use across projects.\r \r Well, they make a clever use of the get submodule\r \r technique\r \r that says for a given project, we are going to clone\r \r the upstream repository of that general box module,\r \r but in a subdirectory\r \r of the project git module.\r \r\n\nSubmodules will take a bit of getting used to. I've used them a couple of times, especially in my blog down,\r \r you know, blog down sites where I have the\r \r Hugo theme as a submodule\r \r for the repository\r \r so that I could, like, you know, keep up to date with the developer of that theme from time to time, or I could just keep it as static as is and not touch it ever since. They're using that similar technique with these general purpose box modules.\r \r That's quite interesting to me, and I think that technique can be used on a variety\r \r of situations.\r \r\n\nSo it was cool to see how Box can be used in, like, a day to day concept.\r \r I will admit I'm personally not not convinced yet to change my workflow, but, nonetheless,\r \r I can see for a team that's still not quite comfortable with package development or package basics,\r \r but yet are familiar with other languages and how they import dependencies,\r \r I can definitely see how this could be a useful fit for them. Curious, Mike. What's your take on this approach here?\r \r\n\n[00:18:24] \r Mike Thomas"

        "trans_text": "Eric, I think this is super powerful\r \r depending on sort of\r \r how\r \r related,\r \r projects are within your organization from project to project.\r \r And I I think if you have\r \r a lot of projects\r \r where there's there's some overlap, right, maybe a little bit of overlap but not not sort of full overlap from project to project to the point where\r \r maybe you you wanna build,\r \r an R package that you know, contains a bunch of functions that you think are are going to be you're gonna use 80, 90% of them, you know, from project to project,\r \r then I think this may be the way to go when you're just trying to borrow sort of bits and pieces,\r \r from different places from from project to project where the the Venn diagram still has overlap from project to project but maybe a little bit, a little bit less where you're just trying to take a little bit here and there. And you're exactly right. It's it's sort of a very Python,\r \r type of mindset that you would have when leveraging the box package. I think it'll be very familiar\r \r to Python folks.\r \r\n\nOne of the third reasons why,\r \r they wanted to or Owen's team\r \r wanted to,\r \r leverage the box package as opposed to construct in our package and this reason is super relatable.\r \r It's that they would have to choose a package name\r \r and he admits that that is that is super hard that choosing a package name can be really difficult, which I will totally totally agree with.\r \r Although,\r \r I think, personally,\r \r that's sort of one of the the fun parts for me about developing R packages is I get to try to use that other side of my brain and then come up with an R package name that I think is is clever,\r \r and hopefully not one that, you know, a month from then I want to change and, because I, you know, at 3 in the morning I thought of a way better package name. You know, occasionally\r \r that may happen, may not happen. But I really do think,\r \r the use of Box can be incredibly powerful if it fits your use case. I I really appreciated the way that Owen,\r \r spelled out the different sub, the different module types\r \r in terms of general modules,\r \r project modules, and local modules because I think that makes a ton of sense in how to do that. I'm not personally familiar with git submodules. It sounds like something that I should\r \r get up to speed on because I can I can see from his explanation here how it would make a lot of sense to to leverage this git sub module technique,\r \r when you're employing, right, functions from these these quote unquote general\r \r modules and you have sort of multiple repositories\r \r potentially\r \r that you're interacting with pulling code from\r \r into the context of the current project\r \r that you're working on? So I think if you\r \r have the ability, capacity, you know, resources, understanding\r \r to leverage these 2 together,\r \r get sub modules in the box framework. I think it can be a really powerful way to develop within your team and and to share, resources,\r \r code,\r \r snippets, things like that, functions,\r \r that you want to leverage from project to project without\r \r introducing, you know, some of the the opinionated overhead that comes with developing in our package. And, Eric, as we always like to say, it's great to have options.\r \r\n\nAnd I think that this is another fantastic\r \r option and this is\r \r one of, you know, I don't I don't wanna\r \r speak out of turn here if I'm not correct, but this is, like, one of the most comprehensive or or best showcase blog posts that I've seen around the box package,\r \r at least recently.\r \r So a huge thanks to Owen for spelling this all out for us in a a really, really nice way.\r \r\n\n[00:22:09] \r Eric Nantz"

        "trans_text": "Yeah. I I fully agree with this. I've been looking for\r \r additional\r \r practical day to day kind of treatments of box or narratives around it.\r \r I mean, like, yeah, we've seen all the stuff from Rhino. We we see why they are using box and and the Rhino framework. But in terms of data analysis, data science in general, I still wasn't quite absorbing it. But this this really hits home, you know, why this is important to them and how how they're leveraging it. Definitely, the principles here I see, you know, no matter which route you take, whether it's box or the package route, because you could think of the submodules\r \r as their way of,\r \r let's imagine I have a Shiny app as a as a project, which I typically do, and I'm using RM for it. And I have as one of my RM package dependencies,\r \r an internal package that's doing a lot of the heavy lifting for analysis.\r \r\n\nSo the sub module is kind of like if I have a separate git repo for that, I'll call back end package.\r \r I make an update in it. But then in r m, I have to opt in to upgrading the package version in r m for that overall app library.\r \r This, the sub module approach is saying, okay. Maybe the team on the that other team has made an update to that general module.\r \r They go into their project modules or they do, like, a get sub module fetch or or pull or whatever, and then they'll get that updated sub module in their project. So it's it's similar to that. And, obviously, people are gonna have preferences, you know, maybe one way or the other or some combination of both for how they keep their dependencies for a project updated.\r \r I do think it's quite elegant, though, because like I said for my Hugo,\r \r blogs, for the my original r podcast site and for my shiny dev series site, I did make use to get submodules\r \r to help keep upstream with the themes that I was using.\r \r\n\nAnd there were times that themes changed quite a bit, but I was like, do I really wanna opt into it yet? So I I got to chose when choose when to opt into it. But then when I did, I just gonna get some module fetcher or whatever, and I was off to the races.\r \r Yep. And you you mentioned lots of powerful ways or powerful ideas from that previous post, Mike. We're gonna really harness on the power aspect in this last highlight highlight here because there's been a lot of momentum in the recent weeks about DuckDV\r \r and the R community.\r \r\n\nAnd this last post is gonna\r \r have somebody who was admittedly a bit skeptical about this and some of their eye opening moments as they kick the tires quite literally on this.

        "trans_text": "Yeah. Well, kudos to you again on that one. But, yeah, this is quite a departure from indentation\r \r because, like us, he has seen\r \r this amazing momentum that DuckDV has had in the community, in particular,\r \r the Duckflyer\r \r package release that was announced about a week or so ago,\r \r and\r \r he he is intrigued. He's still skeptical, but he wanted to see just for his own his own, you know, curiosity\r \r how the recent duct plier package would stack up with data dot table, which, again, has been renowned for many years on performance on large datasets.\r \r So he decided to take matters in his own hands and download a set of parquet files\r \r that corresponding to the New York taxicab\r \r trip dataset, which has been used in quite a few examples talking about high performance and databases and the like.\r \r\n\nAnd he implemented\r \r a few benchmarks\r \r to compare the 2 packages. The, again, duck plier and data dot table. And he implemented a series, I believe, 4 benchmarks,\r \r and using a series of group summary type operations.\r \r Pretty intuitive stuff if you've done any kind of data analysis looking at, like, medium medium pickup times and other,\r \r another similar analysis like that.\r \r And then he shows us the results. In this table here, he ran this in in two scenarios for each benchmark. 1 was using a year's worth of data and one using a quarter year's worth or 3 months of data.\r \r And you see here, when you look at the median timings, in this case, it was 5 reps, so little caveat there.\r \r\n\nThe ratio of improvement of duct plier performance, the data dot table performance in terms of these run times\r \r is between 5 and even up to 70\r \r times\r \r improvement.\r \r Holy jumping. That gets your attention.\r \r And he even admitted he was shocked at this as well.\r \r That that is amazing. Wine to said he needed some wine to take in these results. Yeah. I I probably would need to take a walk away from my desk and be like, what did I just see? Like, that's\r \r amazing.\r \r And so he dives into a bit more about how he, performed this. And by the way, there is a repo. We have all of his, code to set up these benchmarks. So I'll have a link to that in the show notes as well.\r \r But\r \r I think, again, trying to read between the lines here, what Doug Plyer and ductedbee are doing\r \r is a lot of, quote, unquote, lazy evaluation\r \r in terms of not doing the crunching\r \r until you absolutely have to, but it has certainly been optimized\r \r for performance like I didn't even dreamed of.\r \r\n\nAnd, apparently, it's also being very optimal for joining operations as well.\r \r Tim makes, some caveats in the post that there may not be a quite direct apples to apples comparison, so to speak, with the duct flyer and data dot table code because he had to modify the data dot table way of doing things\r \r to not be as,\r \r in, quote, unquote, lazier of our,\r \r approaches.\r \r I'll have to dive into that a bit more,\r \r but he is very upfront that he wants to keep running these benchmarks\r \r as new versions of Datadot Table and Duckplier are released just to kinda see the improvements that we're seeing in performance for each of these\r \r frameworks. But\r \r he seems to be convinced that this is something he's gonna be paying attention\r \r to in his future analysis, and frankly, I am very intrigued as\r \r well. And as I was reading through this prepping for this show, I did have one moment.\r \r\n\nImagine\r \r something I read about a week ago. I'll put this in the show notes as well. With DuckDB,\r \r there is a way that you can read as a read only source,\r \r a DuckDb database\r \r stored in an http endpoint or an s 3 bucket.\r \r You combine that with the forms that we're seeing here.\r \r Oh my goodness. I'm thinking shiny live web assembly with Duck DB with a big day. Oh. Oh. The plot thickens.\r \r I am very intrigued to explore this, and this really hit home that\r \r you could see some massive performance wins in this space. So,\r \r yeah, I was skeptical as well. I remember first hearing about DuckDB and Duckflyer,\r \r but my goodness, this is a heck of a job to convince me that I need to watch this space very closely.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:30:26] \r Mike Thomas"

        "trans_text": "I'm in the same boat, Eric. You know, I saw LinkedIn that you were, interacting with some DuckDV content recently and I follow them and I'm always,\r \r I'm very excited to see\r \r they're developing. It seems like at the speed of light, like, there's new functionality coming out in DuckDV.\r \r I've seen people say that DuckDV has sort of native,\r \r like,\r \r similarity measurement type functions that you could use for, you know, text embeddings and and things like that. And it's it's crazy that something like that, you know, functionality exists in\r \r within DuckDV, but it's it's like there's no end to the possibilities\r \r when it comes to it. And it's sort of really just exploded here,\r \r in the last, I don't know, 12 months something like that\r \r or may maybe more.\r \r\n\nSo it's really interesting and, you know, I think,\r \r Tim, you know, is quick to say at the end of this blog post as well\r \r that, you know, the current performance of data dot table is still very, very good.\r \r And it's it's always been more than just about raw speed. You know, there's people that love the syntax\r \r as well,\r \r and, you know, it's it's sort of Swiss army like functionality\r \r he mentioned. So, you know, even though this this benchmark is against data dot table and I feel like lately we've seen, you know, whether it be Arrow or or DuckDV or something like that, everybody's always benchmarking it against data dot table to show,\r \r you know, how much it can outperform\r \r data. Table maybe because, you know, that was the the prior sort of fastest game\r \r in town. You know, I would have liked to have seen, you know, a benchmark against sort of just raw dplyr\r \r code as well or or base r as well to just get that sort of full comparison and maybe not single out a poor data table so so much, because we do try to support that effort as well. But it's like, you know, like you've said, Eric, it's incredible. It seems, you know, as\r \r the the size of the data and maybe complexity of the operation\r \r increases,\r \r you know, the gap between DuckDBS performance and, you know, take your pick data. Table, whatever, it just seems to widen,\r \r which is is pretty incredible that we're getting, you know, 60, 70 x improvements,\r \r in the timing for some of these queries against, you know, the very famous New York taxi trip dataset, which is is pretty big. You know, Tim notes that\r \r it resulted in a data frame at times occupying\r \r 15 gigs of memory,\r \r in his r session, and and duck duck plier was able to perform all 4 of the queries that he wrote in, like, a little over 2 seconds, which\r \r is is it's incredible. And like you said,\r \r it definitely opens up the possibility\r \r for leveraging DuckDb and and WebAssembly\r \r WASM to be able to to run these things\r \r completely client side,\r \r on a page that doesn't necessarily have, you know, your traditional server behind it, leveraging Shiny Live,\r \r you know, connecting to to s three sources, HTTPS sources,\r \r and\r \r yeah, it's\r \r the the possibilities are are just endless here, and I'm so excited to continue to watch this space and see what happens\r \r in the next next year, 2 years, things like that. Maybe I've spun up, you know, my last digital ocean droplet here in the next next year or 2, because we'll just be deploying everything on on GitHub pages.\r \r\n\nBut we'll we'll have to see. We'll have to see. It's really, really exciting time to be in the data\r \r\n\n[00:33:50] \r Eric Nantz"

He has another post on this issue\r \r about querying JSON files\r \r with AWS\r \r Athena and this Noctua\r \r r package. Now this\r \r is pretty sophisticated stuff, but imagine\r \r you have data collected as JSON files, which, of course, is quite common in the world of web technology and web development,\r \r that you could, with this athena,\r \r service and with the Noctua package,\r \r treat those as if they were a DBI compliant data source and be able to leverage, say, dplyr code\r \r to do manipulations,\r \r do summaries, and whatnot.\r \r\n\nSo, as I think about ways I can\r \r store data interoperability\r \r wise between R and other frameworks that they all can access it efficiently,\r \r I'm definitely gonna keep an eye on this space.

And he tells us all about\r \r how you can chat with AI and large Angular models directly in RStudio itself via\r \r the Chatter package.\r \r\n\nThen on the 10, the easiest way to interact with it is once you install the package\r \r and you link it to the model of your choice, and more on that a little later, you will, by default, be able to bring up a handy little shiny gadget\r \r in the panel of your\r \r rstudio IDE.\r \r And it will look very familiar to those who have used things like chat GPT and other\r \r models online. You give it your prompt,\r \r hit enter, and then you're going to get some feedback back. And\r \r it does do some nice things under the hood that's tailoring it to, say, getting, say, our code for maybe you're developing a package or you're new to a certain package and you want a little snippet. It'll make it super easy for you to copy paste those snippets\r \r directly into your source prompt\r \r and actually going the other way as well.\r \r\n\nPerhaps you're like me, and you like the right markdown for all your expirations of, like, your data analysis and exploring a package.\r \r Maybe you write that question in your markdown file itself.\r \r And also, the Chatter package also has some nice interactions with the\r \r Rstudio add in feature\r \r where you could highlight that, say, text. That would basically be a prompt if you, like, manually typed it in.\r \r Send that directly to Chatter, and then it'll act as if you just prompted it directly. So nice little bidirectional\r \r communication\r \r on that front as well. So very nice kind of user experience on that front.\r \r\n\nNow the parts that I've been pretty intrigued by,\r \r especially as this\r \r technology starts to hopefully get more mature, although it still seems like moving at a breakneck pace,\r \r is that across multiple industries, across many of the people I listen to, there is a lot of interest in, you know, having the ability to self host your large language models\r \r and, hence, potentially being able to leverage the same technology\r \r without it leaving your company's firewall. And in my industry, that is a big, big deal because, we could get in big hot water if we if we transferred some confidential stuff in the OpenAI\r \r suite just on its own.\r \r\n\nWell, that's where Chatter has probably my favorite feature\r \r is the ability to integrate with not just the OpenAI type models of Chat, GPT, and the like, but also\r \r self hosted models.\r \r In particular,\r \r they give first class support\r \r for the chat LOM\r \r models, I believe.\r \r And some of these are coming from Meta\r \r themselves.\r \r And in fact, in particular, it's called Wama GPTJ\r \r chat. Again, some of these are being contributed by Meta and their research group. But with that framework, you can plug in different models that you can download that are freely available.\r \r They talk about WAMA itself, GPTJ,\r \r Mosaic pre chain transformers. Some of these I'm very not familiar of, but the whole idea is that once you install these on your system, you just set a little configuration\r \r in the Chatter package to map to those models.\r \r\n\nAnd then lo and behold, you'll be able to communicate directly\r \r in your network or even on your your computer itself without it again leaving the confines of your firewall or your own setup to go to another service.\r \r I do think that as this technology, yeah, gets more mainstream in industry,\r \r having that flexibility is going to be immensely important.\r \r And I'm very happy to see that even this early version of Chatter\r \r is bringing support for the local model execution,\r \r and they do encourage others to give it a try. And if there are models that they've seen online that are not supported yet, they are inviting,\r \r you know, issues to be filed on their issue tracker. And I'm sure Edgar and the team would love to pursue that further. But overall,\r \r certainly, as developing your R code, developing your package or data analysis,\r \r having a helping hand is never a bad thing. And Chatter gives you the flexibility of going straight to OpenAI\r \r or straight to your local system instead. So we're really happy to see it and can't wait to see where it goes.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:06:26] \r Mike Thomas"

        "trans_text": "Yeah. Eric, this is super exciting and I'm glad that you brought up the the point about the need\r \r for leveraging,\r \r sort of in house LLMs.\r \r You know, I think that in sort of non corporate settings, a lot of the times, right, or if you're just looking for help in your code, potentially, you know, you can leverage something like OpenAI or some of these these models where you are sending information to a third party service. Essentially, anything that you type is is probably gonna be captured and and used to retrain that model, if not for other purposes. And and, you know, that's okay a lot of the time. But if you are asking a question that's sort of specific to, you know, the the IP of your own organization or company, right, it's probably not a very good idea to do that. Your,\r \r your your information security team is probably not gonna be too happy if you start doing that.\r \r\n\nSo the fact that we have the ability to integrate here in our studio with some of these, you know, sort of, in house LLMs, you know, that that are open source and we can install and host ourselves\r \r is fantastic.\r \r I wasn't necessarily familiar with all of them. I do know that the Mosaic,\r \r pre trained\r \r Mosaic is a company that I believe was,\r \r you know, leading in this space and they were acquired by Databricks\r \r not too long ago.\r \r Then, I guess, the one other thing that I do wanna point out is if you are,\r \r someone who's sort of like me, who's been using Versus Code a little bit more, lately than RStudio, that's okay. You don't have to just be in the RStudio\r \r IDE. You know, this article highlights Chatter's integration with with RStudio's\r \r IDE.\r \r\n\nSpecifically, you know, all the screenshots are sort of Rstudio native, but,\r \r you know, this will all work outside of Rstudio as well, you know, for example, in the terminal. So it's a great walk through on on getting set up and and getting started. I think it's it's hugely helpful, you know. I have sort of mixed feelings as I'm sure you do about Eric. You do, Eric, about large language models and their utility.\r \r You know, I think I was probably a little bit more\r \r pessimistic about them when they first came out and I think they're growing on me a little bit to be honest.\r \r 1 I listened to a great podcast this weekend,\r \r that was with the chief operating officer of GitHub.\r \r\n\nAnd\r \r long this is just sort of a side story, but I live in this this very rural farm town in Connecticut as you know, Eric.\r \r Not much around. We're not we're not close to to any cities or anything like that.\r \r And the chief operating officer of GitHub\r \r lives 4 minutes away from my house and I never knew.\r \r Wow. In a small world. I sent him a little LinkedIn message\r \r to see if we're gonna get together sometime but I haven't heard back yet so I I don't blame him. But, no. It was very interesting and one of the points that he was talking about which I hadn't necessarily considered before is you know we talk a lot Eric about you know maintaining open source software and how it can be thankless sometimes. Right? There's not a lot of payoff there. But he was thinking about a world where, you know, somebody opens an issue in your, you know, open source repository that you have and maybe, you know, Copilot or or some sort of LLM is able to\r \r immediately\r \r show you some code to solve that issue. And obviously, you can go in and edit it, but any time savings that we can provide to open source maintainers,\r \r I think could be a huge benefit to the whole community and especially, you know, the many folks that work on open source that really don't get much back for it.\r \r\n\nSo I I thought that was interesting.\r \r They're growing on me. I I love seeing this article come out because I I think that this integration is very timely and looking forward to continuing to watch, you know, how this space evolves.\r \r\n\n[00:10:03] \r Eric Nantz"

Yeah. Yeah. We're not there yet.\r \r But, however, I can definitely see\r \r the point of bridging that gap between doing\r \r so many things manually,\r \r such as looking up the concepts of a different language as you're folding maybe a custom JavaScript pipeline\r \r or custom, like, Linux, you know, operation into your typical data workflow.\r \r\n\nHaving that helping hand to be able to guide you with additional development best practices or snippets that get you\r \r started quickly, I think, is still\r \r the the the type of low hanging fruit that I think cannot be understated how valuable it is to get that extra helping hand. I think over time as these models get, you know,\r \r more updated, more trained, hopefully, with best practices for training those that we're all going to benefit from. But again, to me, the flexibility\r \r to be able to pivot to the direction that you choose,\r \r I think, is is definitely paramount here. And, yeah, for you Versus Code fans,\r \r guess what? The Versus Code, extension for R does indeed have support for RStudio add ins. So you should be able to use Chatter\r \r kind of out of the box even in your Versus Code setup. I haven't tried it yet, but I've been able to use add ins in the past with things like Logdown\r \r and other packages that had these nice little add in integration. So, yeah, who knows? Give that a try, listener out there, if you're a Versus Code power user because, I would imagine Chatter is gonna fit right in there.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:11:54] \r Mike Thomas"

        "trans_text": "Yeah. You can definitely see it. And in fact, he actually gave a a talk at the 2023 r pharma conference about some of his developments. So I'll have a link to that in the show notes.\r \r Now we told you how, you know, using things like large diameter miles can make things a bit faster for your development. Well, another thing that you want faster, especially when things go haywire, is if you're in the package development mindset\r \r and you're starting to do the right thing. If you've been listening to us and others in the community,\r \r you write your function. You know that function is important.\r \r\n\nMake a test for that, folks. It'll\r \r save you so much time and effort in the long run.\r \r Well, you may be in situations\r \r where you're writing a function\r \r that definitely has a lot going on, so to speak. Maybe it takes a lot of time to execute.\r \r Maybe it's impact it's interacting with some, you\r \r know, API that needs a little time to digest things.\r \r And you wanna still keep in the workflow of being able to test this efficiently,\r \r especially when things go haywire.\r \r And our next highlight here comes from Mike Mahoney, a PhD candidate who has also had definitely more than a few contributions to our weekly in the past where he talks about some of his recent explorations\r \r in helping to decipher\r \r the ways to fail fast\r \r in your test with respect to custom warnings and errors.\r \r\n\nAnd what we're talking about here is that typically speaking, when you have a function that's depending on some kind of user input,\r \r you probably wanna have some guardrails around it to make sure the inputs are meeting the specific needs of that back end processing.\r \r And if you detect that something's out of line, you will often wanna send a message to the user\r \r or in some cases, even a warning\r \r or an error right off the bat to the user that something is not right. They're gonna have to go and try it again.\r \r Well, maybe it is more of a warning concept or maybe they'll still get a result, but it may not be quite what they\r \r expect. And what Mike does in his example here, he has a little mock function that is intentionally meant to take a while,\r \r but he's making clever use of the rlang package\r \r to not only display the message to the user,\r \r but also attach a custom class to that message.\r \r\n\nI glossed over this years ago when I got familiar with\r \r Rlang and CLI, but this is a handy little feature because if you\r \r attach a class to this type of message or warning or error\r \r in your test to determine if that said warning or error actually fires,\r \r instead of having to test for the verbatim text of that message that it was showed to the user,\r \r you can test for that class of a message, which might be handy if you have more than one of these in a given function.\r \r Now that on its own, he's got an example where he builds a test to do that in his test suite.\r \r But there's one bit issue that, again, if you have an expensive function you're going to run it into,\r \r is that the function is still going to try to go through the rest of the processing even if your test for that warning is successful.\r \r\n\nWell, how do you get it so that you wanna, say, escape the hatch, so to speak, when that warning occurs?\r \r That's where the the rest of the example that Mike puts together here. He develops a nice little trick that's making use of the try catch function,\r \r which comes in base r, and it's a way for you to evaluate a function.\r \r And if you detect that there's an error, you can tell what to do in that post processing.\r \r So what Mike does in this example is he takes the detection\r \r of that warning condition in his function, which, in this case, is making a huge number\r \r with, going above the machine integer max.\r \r\n\nAnd then in his try catch block,\r \r he's got, okay, he expect an error that\r \r that error being actually\r \r a warning message instead of a typical error. So he does a little clever thing here, and this is not modifying the function itself. It's modifying the test that declaration of that function.\r \r So the function itself still has that nice, succinct syntax of if the integer is too big, send the warning, carry on. But it's in the test that block that he switches it a bit and says, I'm gonna expect that error for that warning condition.\r \r And that way, that the warning does indeed output as I expect. It's just gonna get out, and then I get on with my day, so to speak.\r \r\n\nNow this may not be a one size fits all for everybody because maybe there are cases where\r \r you're still gonna wanna test if that function does perform successfully.\r \r But I could definitely see as you're in, like, the iterative development workflow\r \r that you'll want that flexibility to say, okay. I just wanna test for my air conditioning first\r \r and then not get bogged down with the execution time in that iterative process. And then when I feel like I'm confident enough, then start building in the rest of the testing suite. Again, testing and development practices can be a highly personal thing,\r \r but I just love the use of these\r \r built in features of r to kinda make your day to day a bit easier\r \r in your testing suite. So a short example here, easy to digest,\r \r but I think it's got immense value,\r \r especially if you're in your early days of building that really\r \r\n\n[00:17:44] \r Mike Thomas"

I'm again, great nugget of wisdom here that I'm gonna be taking into my\r \r packages that I have to deal with either launching, say, a complicated model\r \r or interacting with an API that I have no control over,\r \r who maybe those engineers didn't exactly make it efficient on the back end. So if I wanna fail, I wanna fail fast, and hence, it's gonna be a nice little snippet that I can take into my dev toolbox to make it fail fast and still keep that function pretty pure in the process.\r \r And speaking of making things easy for you, again, going back into the package development mindset,\r \r you've done that awesome work. You've got that package ready to go.\r \r\n\nAnd then you're at that point of, am I really ready for CRAN yet?\r \r It can be a daunting task, but there are there's been an existing resource for us in the R community for over 8 years\r \r that has been immensely helpful as another sanity check to our package,\r \r especially with respect to different environments and different architectures.\r \r Well, what we're the project we're talking about has been the Rhub project,\r \r which has been led by Gabor Saasardi, a software engineer at Pozit.\r \r I believe Ma'al Salmons also contributed heavily to this project as well. Well, they have a very big milestone right now in our last highlight here because they are officially announcing in their blog post is that they are moving to R hub version 2.\r \r And, like I said, the impact that Rhub has had on the community itself cannot\r \r be understated\r \r with respect to package development\r \r and helping authors really get to the nitty gritty of how their package is gonna work across different architecture.\r \r\n\nAnd this has a rich history. As I said, this was actually a project funded\r \r by the R Consortium,\r \r which I've spoken highly about\r \r all the way back in 2015.\r \r So it has been standing up for years.\r \r Now why is this version 2 so exciting? Well, they are making\r \r major\r \r pivots to their infrastructure\r \r where a lot of this has been, in essence, self made or homegrown\r \r in terms of\r \r architectures for containers and servers.\r \r Now they are piggybacking\r \r off of GitHub actions\r \r to help automate many of these same checks\r \r and more that they've been doing in our hub over the years.\r \r And if that doesn't sound familiar, there has been another project we've been speaking highly about called r Universe that is also heavily invested in the GitHub Action route. So now that's 2\r \r major, major influences in the development,\r \r community for r that are making a big headway here.\r \r\n\nNow you as the end user, I. E. The package author wants to leverage this version of rhub. What do you have to do?\r \r The good news is there's always been a package called rhub literally in our ecosystem itself.\r \r You just gotta update that package to the latest version that they're announcing here. And then I believe you might have to reregister\r \r for interaction with the service. But if you've done it before,\r \r it should be a fairly seamless operation.\r \r And then the mechanism to you as the end user is exactly the same. You're gonna be able to supply\r \r or request that your package be checked in a more custom way. More on that in a minute. But we have a special configuration\r \r file that goes to your GitHub repository.\r \r\n\nAssuming your package source code is on GitHub,\r \r it'll be like a YAML file that in your main branch of the repo and optionally any custom branch\r \r that on every push to that said branch, it'll trigger in GitHub actions\r \r these other rhub version 2 checks. So then you can check the progress on that in the GitHub actions dialogue much like you would in any other GitHub action.\r \r I've been in I've been living in GitHub actions over the years, so it's becoming much more comfortable to me, albeit still not 100% yet. But again, they're taking all the hard work for you. You just got to put this configuration in your repo and the R Hub package itself will let you do that very quickly.\r \r And like I said, there are opportunities if you don't want to host your package itself on GitHub\r \r and still want to take advantage of something like GitHub Actions,\r \r there is a mechanism, a path forward for you as well\r \r where you can leverage\r \r the custom runners that the R Hub team has put together\r \r that are hosted under the R Consortium\r \r itself\r \r as these on demand runners, which would be similar to what you saw\r \r in the previous version of RHub.\r \r\n\nBut this is useful if you want to keep your package outside of GitHub\r \r and still want to leverage these kind of checks.\r \r There are a couple of caveats, though. Once you opt into this kind of check,\r \r obviously, the checks that are being run-in this Rhub, GitHub, Org under the R Consortium\r \r are still going to be public. So if you're okay with that, great. But, that's just something to keep in mind.\r \r With that said, I do think that this is gonna help the team immensely\r \r with their back end infrastructure.\r \r And, hopefully, you as the end user will be able to seamlessly opt into this, especially if you've already been invested in rhub. It should be a pretty seamless operation.\r \r And if you're new to rhub, it sounds like this is gonna be even faster for you and even more reliable\r \r and, hopefully, you know, get you on your way with more efficient package development.\r \r\n\nSo big congratulations\r \r\n\n[00:24:09] \r Mike Thomas"

We got a whole smorgasbord of\r \r package highlights, new updates,\r \r and existing packages, getting major updates,\r \r tutorials,\r \r great uses of data science across the board. So it'll take a couple of minutes for our additional finds here.\r \r\n\nAnd as I've been leveraging different, you know, data back ends for my data expirations,\r \r especially with huge datasets,\r \r I've been looking into things like, you know, of course, historically SQLite,\r \r DuckDB now, you know, Parquet. It's all it's all coming together as they say.\r \r Art Steinmis has a great post on our weekly, this issue,\r \r about the truth about tidy wrappers. It's a provocative title, but if you ever want a technical deep dive into kind of the benefits and trade offs of performance\r \r and other considerations\r \r with some of these wrappers that you heard about that say, let you use dplyr with, say, you know, relational databases,\r \r parquet files, DuckDB.\r \r\n\nThis post is for you. It is a very comprehensive treatment,\r \r lots of example metrics so you can make an informed decision\r \r as you look at the datasets you're analyzing in your particular project\r \r and seeing if it's a right fit to stick with the wrappers\r \r or to go full native with the respective database engine. So really, thought provoking read, and great post by Art on that one. And, Mike, what did you find? No. It's a great find, Eric. I found\r \r\n\n[00:29:56] \r Mike Thomas"

They're trying to encourage, you know, some commitment to the folks that actually say that they're going to,\r \r register\r \r for this. And and I think they're looking forward to, this day. And I'm going to to try to make it if possible. I'll have to see if the logistics\r \r all line up. But this is super exciting. Just another thing that I love about open source. The fact that, you know, they're going to have a day dedicated to this, a very open sort of forum for folks to help contribute to code that's going to get used by, you know, 1,000, if not tens or 100 of 1,000 or millions of people around the world.

I mean, only a few steps to field in our neighborhood to check it out with a few, friends and and kids around. So, yeah, all in all, a good time.\r \r Temperature goes way down. You in about 3 minutes, it looked like we were in twilight zone. But, hey, I won't complain. It was a a ton of fun, and the world has still survived. So didn't have any, like, y two k issues from yesterday or anything like that. Internet is still on. It is still on. We're still recording here. And, thankfully, the Internet's on because that means that y'all can see the latest Our Weekly issue, which we're going to be talking about now,\r \r which has been curated by John Calder, another one of our\r \r long time contributors and curators on the project.\r \r\n\nAnd as always, he had tremendous help from our fellow Rwicky team members\r \r and contributors like all of you around the world.\r \r Well, one of the rweekly highlights, especially in the last few months, if we didn't check-in with a good a good friend of the show who is continuing\r \r his journey with Knicks and r. And, of course, I am speaking about\r \r Bruno Rodriguez and his latest blog post on his blog,\r \r which is part 11.\r \r Yes.\r \r 11 of this series of reproducible data science with Nix.\r \r And this is gonna have a lot of aspects that I think you as a user and as a developer\r \r will both sympathize with. And I think open your eyes. There are a couple really interesting things that we can do\r \r with this ecosystem.\r \r\n\nHow does this part of the journey begin?\r \r Starts innocently enough\r \r with\r \r a package that Bruno has released years ago called chronicler.\r \r And he gets an email from the crane maintainers\r \r saying that there's been a failure in the build.\r \r What does this mean? So, of course, he checks out the CRAN package results.\r \r And this is where things start to really get out here because\r \r there is only\r \r 2 instances\r \r of r on Linux, and in particular, the Fedora distribution of Linux,\r \r that have the failure of the checks, yet\r \r Debian\r \r as well as, of course, the Windows and macOS\r \r test\r \r results all pass.\r \r\n\nNow that is a head scratcher in and of its own because intuitively would think\r \r if there was a failure,\r \r a, would happen everywhere,\r \r and, b, even if it was isolated to Linux, that would hap but not all the Linux distributions that is checking. But that is not the case here.\r \r And so Bruno starts a little detective work. Right?\r \r And then he realizes,\r \r well, what would have happened on that particular day of the failure?\r \r Sure enough,\r \r there was an update to one of the dependencies.\r \r I would say a dependency of a dependency\r \r of his Chronicler package because it's not that obvious.\r \r\n\nBut in particular, the tidy select package, which for those aren't aware,\r \r is what powers now many of the tidyverse packages,\r \r functions that have to do with helpers in your select calls,\r \r like maybe select one of of the starts of a string or things like that.\r \r Well, it just so happened that tidy select got a new version\r \r on this day or at least the day before\r \r that this failure came to be.\r \r Now, again, you're wondering\r \r why on earth\r \r would this only affect\r \r one of the Linux variants.\r \r Turns out that Fedora\r \r is compiling the packages from source on each of these test runs, whereas\r \r the Debian distribution,\r \r and Debian is actually\r \r the base of the very popular Ubuntu distribution,\r \r that is using binaries of packages when they're available.\r \r\n\nBut for Fedora, they're not as available, these binary\r \r versions of packages. And, hence,\r \r a, you know,\r \r recently updated version of tidy select landed on the Fedora version,\r \r and there was an update in the tidy select,\r \r functions\r \r where an error message, in this case for eval select,\r \r was giving a more targeted message in terms of where that was actually happening in a select operation versus a subset operation.\r \r And Bruno, you know, listening to the advice of many package authors,\r \r has a very sophisticated automated testing suite\r \r where he is able\r \r to pinpoint one of the errors where this was failing\r \r because he was\r \r on the actual context of the error message or one of these select calls. We'll actually have a link in the show notes to this exact test because I I was just doing a bunch of testing for an internal package myself. So I'm always curious what others are doing in this space. And sure enough, yeah, that test was being triggered.\r \r\n\nBut because the other versions of Linux were not updated with the new tidy select binary yet,\r \r those pass the flying colors because that error message was the same as what he had built it on.\r \r Well,\r \r okay. Now what?\r \r Now what could we do differently here or at least what he could do differently here?\r \r Well, now that he's narrowed down where this failure occurred,\r \r where could Nix come in here?\r \r Well, he has a development environment\r \r that's powered by Nix now for building his packages. And, of course, for those who haven't heard the previous episodes, we've been talking about his Rix package,\r \r a way to help our users bootstrap these Nix\r \r like manifest to bring in dependencies of our packages\r \r and be able to constrain those particular versions and whatnot.\r \r\n\nWell, he wondered, you know, would this happen on nix? Well, what's interesting enough, and this is another nugget for me, especially some I'll get to in a little bit,\r \r is that the packages\r \r in NICS that are that are literally corresponding to our packages themselves\r \r are actually\r \r not updated\r \r until\r \r a new release of our hits.\r \r This is actually kind of marrying a lot of what many of us in the life sciences industry deal with in terms of our internal R installations\r \r where there's a central library of packages, but they don't really get updated\r \r until a new version of R is released and deployed in production, and then we refresh the library\r \r with those. And, apparently,\r \r these stable\r \r releases on next follow that same paradigm,\r \r which that that's kind of food for thought for me as I think about ways of making\r \r environments a little more hardened as they say. But that's, again kind of a digression here.\r \r\n\nSo\r \r Bruno, what he wanted to do here is that, well, what what can he do to catch this more in real time\r \r with Nicks?\r \r And, of course, he has these nice mechanisms in place based on his learning\r \r to update what are called expressions in next to cat to bring in more up to date versions of packages. And he was able to do that with tidy select\r \r and then be able to then replicate the error on nicks that he was getting on that cran check Infidora.\r \r So with that, of course, now he's updated his unit test for chronicler\r \r to account for this new message.\r \r\n\nThat could be it right there.\r \r But Bruno, like me, likes to, go go a bit further deep in this and think about what is there a way to have\r \r these more up to date versions of packages\r \r kind of add availability\r \r whenever he needs it instead of, like, custom doing this for\r \r one off packages here and there like you did with this tidy select situation.\r \r Well, another thing that we've been plugging a lot is using automation when you can. Right?\r \r And\r \r so Nix can be incorporated quite nicely in GitHub actions,\r \r which is, of course, a great way for you to run, like, your CICD testing suite and whatnot\r \r for package development.\r \r\n\nBut could you also combine this with bootstrapping\r \r environments of our packages,\r \r much like how we often do with r env in a lot of our GitHub actions where we use r env to take in the versions of packages we we use for a given project. And then to get an actual look at that lock file,\r \r install everything, and then be just as if we are on our development machine, give or take a few differences,\r \r with that particular environment.\r \r There is a way to, of course, do this on Nick's, but he had to do a little bit of magic along the way.\r \r Well, him and his colleague,\r \r Philip Bowman\r \r have started a GitHub organization\r \r with their fork\r \r of the Nix packages\r \r repository, which basically contains all the expressions for every\r \r package that's built in the Nix ecosystem. And, yes, this includes\r \r r itself\r \r and the packages within r that are built with these next expressions.\r \r\n\nSo in theory, you could take this, clone it, update the expression to get, like, a more up to date version of the package.\r \r Well, as that version gets up to date, guess what it's gonna have to do? There are no binaries of that new version available at that time,\r \r which means you're compiling from source.\r \r And yes, if you ever compiled stuff in the tidy verse from source and you're on Linux,\r \r get yourself a coffee or a favorite water beverage, you're gonna be there a while.\r \r Ain't nobody got time for that. Right, Mike?\r \r\n\n[00:10:38] \r Mike Thomas"

        "trans_text": "Take a walk. Get get those steps in, but you don't wanna do that over and over again because you can only do so much walking in the day probably. But\r \r there there is a happy medium here. There is a happy ending to this. And that is\r \r you can actually, in the Nix ecosystem,\r \r have your\r \r own binary\r \r cache of binary versions of packages. And that is using this service\r \r called cachex,\r \r which I had never heard about until this post. But, basically, one of the things I've been benoming\r \r in my early days of my next journey\r \r is the fact that I was having to compile some of our packages from source. And I was living that that\r \r very, time\r \r this the time sync situation that we were just referencing. But, apparently, with cache x is that you can hook that up to your maybe GitHub action that Bruno is working on here. And in essence, there's some clever manipulation\r \r of how this is triggered.\r \r\n\nHe's got a process now where every day,\r \r maybe it's multiple times a day,\r \r that then there is a push to this repo that's gonna do the caching.\r \r And then that is gonna automatically\r \r build these packages if they're new and then push them to this custom cachex\r \r binary cache\r \r such that if he builds an expression from this point on with next and then he is able to reference this custom cache\r \r in his kind of preamble for the expression,\r \r it will figure out that, a, is this version of, say, tidy select\r \r available on the\r \r custom cache that Bruno set up? If yes, it's gonna pull down that binary version right away.\r \r\n\nAnd if it's not in the bind not in that cache x, it's gonna look for most likely where it will be is the default Nix repository for binary cache. If it's a package that hasn't been updated in months, it's probably gonna be there in the next stable repository, and it's gonna pull from that binary cache. So in essence, he's got his he's got a workflow now where he can pull these binary versions\r \r either from his custom cache\r \r or from the default NICS cache.\r \r That to me is massive, folks. That is absolutely massive because this was arguably\r \r one of the biggest deterrents I've seen thus far in my limited experience of Knicks that may have just been solved for this quote unquote developer setup.\r \r\n\nI'm really intrigued by this because\r \r this may be something I want to plug in to my package development because now I actually have 1 or 2 open source packages under my name that are starting to get used by some people that I'm I'm working with. I wanna make sure that I'm up to date\r \r on these issues, albeit they're not on CRAN yet. But at the same time, if they ever to get on CRAN, I want to harden my development set up for this.\r \r So this is an amazing approach that, again, everything's in the open. They got links, and Bruno's got links in the to the GitHub repository\r \r where this cache is being built and this other custom repository that's doing kind of the triggering\r \r of all this. I think there are a lot of principles here that we all can take from a developer perspective\r \r to give ourselves extra peace of mind\r \r for these cases where Kran might have some mysterious errors in these checks. And, of course, they're not gonna tell you how deep the rabbit hole goes of which dependency of a dependency actually caused a failure. It's on you as the as a package maintainer to figure that piece out.\r \r\n\nBut this may be a step in the right direction to be more proactive\r \r in figuring that out. And so I'll be paying attention to this work flow and maybe grabbing some nuggets of this as I continue on my,\r \r albeit it's still baby steps, but I've been\r \r venturing and running NICS on a virtual machine,\r \r trying to start bootstrapping our environments, bootstrapping my other tools of choice from a developer perspective.\r \r And this one, I'm definitely gonna keep an eye on as another way to augment my, my potential workflow here. So again, this post had a mix of everything. The detective work to figure out just which dependency caused this error,\r \r fixing the annoyance of having to compile all this manually every single time. And lo and behold, we got some really fancy GitHub actions and caching to to thank Bruno for. So kudos to Bruno for this immense\r \r rabbit hole journey here in this part of the next journey.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:15:19] \r Mike Thomas"

        "trans_text": "Yeah. It is a little bit of a rabbit hole, Eric, but I I think there's a lot in here that\r \r might be useful to to those using Nix and maybe those even not using Nix or those maybe on their journey\r \r as well. You know, one thing that sort of stood out to me is for anyone that has a unit test,\r \r in their their R package or their,\r \r you know,\r \r our repository and that unit test is is maybe running up programmatically or on some schedule or something like that, you should probably be aware that in the latest version of the tidy select package,\r \r if you have a dplyr select call and\r \r write your that the error message that's going to get returned if one of the columns in that select statement doesn't exist. It used to say can't subset columns that don't exist. Now it says can't select columns\r \r that don't exist. So if you have an expect error\r \r call in your unit test and you're looking specifically for, that keyword subset,\r \r that's not going to to fire anymore. So that test is actually gonna fail\r \r because it that that rejects\r \r those strings will not match essentially so you may need to go in and update your unit test and take a look at the unit test that you have across your different R packages and repositories to to make sure that you are not too going to get bit by this issue the same way that Bruno did,\r \r and it was really interesting to me as well,\r \r how, you know, the binaries\r \r I guess of the\r \r the the release before,\r \r I guess, the 1.2.0\r \r release of Tidy Select, which is now, quote unquote, the old version,\r \r were the versions of Tidy Select getting installed, on Debian and Windows and and Mac,\r \r you know, for these crayon\r \r package checks, but it was compiling from source\r \r on fedora so that's you know there's there's all these these funky things\r \r that take place you know that we I think we see all the time\r \r that are huge head scratchers for when your your packages are going through these automated tests across all these different\r \r operating systems,\r \r when when they're trying to pass their crayon checks.\r \r\n\nRight? They'll pass 9 of them and then the 10th one will fail. And it'll probably make you wanna throw your computer out the window half the time.\r \r But, you know, it just sometimes takes a little investigative work like like Bruno did or maybe,\r \r you know,\r \r diving into your your r four d s Slack community or your Mastodon community,\r \r and trying to figure out,\r \r collectively\r \r what's going on here. And hopefully, it didn't take Bruno too long to to figure that out. But, you know, as you you mentioned, I think, Nick's actually is going to\r \r allow him to\r \r easily, you know, handle these types of situations\r \r in the future,\r \r where his unit tests need to ensure that they're running against the latest versions\r \r of all packages or or maybe, you know, on some OS's,\r \r it'll be, you know, building the the latest binaries versus on other OS's, the latest,\r \r packages\r \r compiled from source.\r \r\n\nSo, you know, I think\r \r one avenue again to to try to do some of this stuff, you know, might be having all sorts of different docker images,\r \r to handle all these different edge cases and and use cases and operating systems. But it seems like Nix actually might be a more streamlined,\r \r and efficient workflow to be able to to make those switches\r \r a little bit quicker and run those tests, within different environments a little quicker\r \r to to spin up VMs or something like that or install, you know, all sorts of different versions of our locally and all sorts of different versions of our packages locally and and you know just sort of cross your fingers that, you know, that your package checks would succeed on other operating systems that you didn't really necessarily have any access to.\r \r So you know that's really interesting and then and then maybe the last thing I'll point out here that I thought was interesting and and useful you know one a lot of times when we're you know, running GitHub actions. Right? It's it's running on some piece of compute that we we don't have full access to. So it's we're relying really on a YAML file at the end of the day and maybe this goes back to who was it? Yaron Ooms that authored that blog post a couple weeks ago about like,\r \r you know, workflows\r \r in our Oh. And Oh. You know, that's not repeat yourself. Miles Macbain. Miles Macbain. Oh. Miles Macbain. That's exactly who it was. Yeah. Oh, my goodness. This sort of brings me back to that where you know eventually\r \r you get to try to just do everything with it a YAML file and it would drive you crazy but,\r \r we're at the mercy you know with GitHub actions actions, you know, for better or for worse a lot has been abstracted for us which is awesome but we're at the mercy of, a YAML file. Right? To be able to handle,\r \r you know, setting up that that piece of compute, that runner and GitHub actions, installing the dependencies\r \r on there.\r \r\n\nAnd, you know, one thing I think that can be be tricky sometimes is is maybe authenticating\r \r it into different services that you wanna leverage. And that was my first thought here when I was taking a look at the this cache x,\r \r this cache utility here\r \r that allows you to to cache, different,\r \r packages,\r \r within sort of your next environment. But one of the interesting things is that you don't need to authenticate\r \r to cache x to simply pull binaries.\r \r All Bruno had to do was was really just these two lines of YAML specifying\r \r the cache x GitHub action version that he wants to use and then he has a particular name I assume you know he's logged into the cache x platform\r \r and and developed his own cache. That's that's b dash rodriguez,\r \r and that's where his cache lives, and that's all he has to specify in his GitHub action to be able to pull,\r \r binaries from that cache. So I think that's\r \r incredibly powerful,\r \r really nice that how\r \r simplified sort of this workflow is to be able to set up, your cache x cache,\r \r it within a GitHub Actions workflow. So fantastic blog post from start to finish. It really walks us through sort of the entire problems problem space and and how he was able to solve it.\r \r\n\nAnd another feather in in Nick's cap, I would say.\r \r\n\n[00:21:37] \r Eric Nantz"

So, yeah, there is a danger sometimes\r \r of having the abstraction too high up versus what lower level it's doing. And the other piece of advice I'll give\r \r is that, you know, it may seem intimidating to be like, these these kind of actions are doing such magical things with these YAMLs.\r \r You know what's behind these actions most of the time? It's shell scripting. It's just doing stuff on Linux and then be able to troubleshoot that.\r \r\n\nSo, like, I went into the GitHub action source of some of those quartile actions, and I figured out, okay. So these kind of quartile commands with this Boolean check if, like, I have this render flag enabled or not. Then I realized, you know what? Okay. I can take matters in my own hands. I can do my own custom rendering.\r \r It's not as intimidating as it sounds. It's just the bugging can be a complete nightmare unless you know where to look.

Right?\r \r Speaking of major updates that we're seeing in the ecosystems\r \r these days in terms of the tooling we use, another one I've kept my very close eye on with a lot of influential projects I'm trying to bootstrap right now is we are happy to talk about a new release\r \r for WebR itself.\r \r When this blog post comes from the tidyverse blog and authored by the WebR architect and brilliant,\r \r engineer George Stagg, who is in this blog post\r \r getting us through, you know, or talking us through a few of these major updates that we see in the WebR ecosystem.\r \r\n\nAnd I'm going to speak to a few of these. And I know some of these I'm going to be able to benefit one very quickly, I would imagine.\r \r But the first major of note is that now they are basing WebR on the latest stable release of R itself because\r \r in essence, they have to bootstrap R with a couple of the custom shims\r \r under the hood to make it seem like you're installing a package from a default repository where instead you're installing it from WebR's\r \r binary package repository. So they always have to, in essence, patch R to make all this work. And now they patch the latest stable version of R, which, of course, will be great for\r \r consistency with maybe your typical environment that you're building these analyses on. And another\r \r great feature that I think the users are going to definitely notice\r \r is some improved air reporting too.\r \r\n\nWhereas in the past, you might see a custom, like, uncalled exemption\r \r if something crazy was happening in the WebR process\r \r with respect to maybe an error in the r code itself.\r \r Well, now you're gonna be able to see the actual error in the JavaScript console whenever WebR is running,\r \r which, of course, is going to help you\r \r immensely with the bugging\r \r to narrow down, oh, did I get the JavaScript code wrong that I'm using WebR with, or was it in my R code itself? So\r \r that, again, for usability,\r \r a massive improvement for the quality of life.\r \r And speaking of quality of life enhancements,\r \r ones that you'll they'll hopefully be able to see and interact with\r \r is big improvements to the graphics engine.\r \r\n\nBecause now the graphics that are drawn with WebRx,\r \r they call it the canvas function,\r \r they're gonna be captured in that R based session\r \r in a similar way so that it's consistent with other output types that you would see in a normal installation of R,\r \r which is leading to more streamlined, you know, interaction with these graphics.\r \r And, also, along those lines,\r \r graphics that you create in Base R have had massive improvements to the rendering engine. And the blog post, when you see this linked in our weekly, you'll see\r \r very sharp looking images\r \r that they're able to produce when you evaluate that code. Even as I'm talking now, I'm running through these snippets, and they look very nice. Great anti alias text.\r \r\n\nThe symbols with the r logo look really sharp.\r \r Everything looks as if you were in your native r session. Again,\r \r just massive\r \r amazing improvements\r \r under the hood to make this, you know, very seamless and attractive to the end user.\r \r And it doesn't just stop\r \r with graphic objects.\r \r There has been a lot of under the hood enhancements\r \r as well as some new user facing\r \r enhancements\r \r that the R objects that are created in these WebR processes\r \r are going to be\r \r more easily converted back and forth between their JavaScript counterparts and their R counterparts.\r \r Where does this fit in the big picture?\r \r\n\nThe big thing for me is the data frame and r that is literally the fundamental building block of pricing 99%\r \r of my analyses.\r \r Now, of course, in r, you have your columns and you got your rows. Right? That's not always what JavaScript treats data as, especially if you're familiar with d 3.\r \r It is definitely a different type of layout you often see where it's basically the column is\r \r given\r \r a name. It's like a named vector of things in a row wise type fashion layout.\r \r But there are functions now in WebR\r \r to go back and forth\r \r between\r \r these JavaScript\r \r notations\r \r and the R native\r \r kind of representations.\r \r\n\nIn fact, there's a handy function\r \r called\r \r 2d3,\r \r where you can simply take that data frame in the R process, put it into a format that you could feed in any of your custom d three visualizations.\r \r These things are massive for that interoperability\r \r between maybe using r to do the heavy lifting statistically.\r \r But if you're familiar with JavaScript and you wanna keep with those JavaScript visuals,\r \r have at it. Have your d three magic and be able to get that that construct of the data as you need it. So,\r \r again, great way for you to take maybe baby steps if you're new to R, but you're familiar with JavaScript, a way to get the best of both worlds. Really,\r \r really a big fan of that.\r \r\n\nAnd then some really fun plumbing type enhancements here that I'm paying a lot of attention to\r \r is that with collaboration,\r \r you named dropped them earlier, Mike, your own ooms as well as,\r \r Utahn.\r \r They have\r \r new system libraries\r \r in the WebR process and as well as a custom WebR Docker container. Hey. Containers again for you.\r \r Which they've included some new numeric libraries\r \r as well as the ImageMagick\r \r image manipulation\r \r suite.\r \r And wait for it. There is now a Rust compiler configured\r \r so that if your R package involves Rust in some way, you're not gonna be able to compile that into web assembly 2.\r \r Absolutely amazing stuff.\r \r\n\nAnd to really, you know, you know,\r \r intrigue you even further,\r \r embedded in the post\r \r is a Shiny Live powered web app\r \r from your own himself\r \r on using that magic package that he's created in the past. But now in the blog post where you can absolutely distort or make fun of this random cat image.\r \r And I'm literally doing it right now as I speak.\r \r It is so responsive so quick.

I think, you know, probably the biggest thing for me as a,\r \r you know, practitioner, somebody who who's very\r \r data,\r \r hands on in most of our projects as well as as you talked about, Eric. The ability\r \r to to switch back and forth, between JavaScript\r \r sort of data frame objects, you know, especially,\r \r I guess, particularly in this case,\r \r we're talking about raw objects\r \r of typed array\r \r array buffer and array buffer view those are the types of raw vector\r \r objects that may now be used to construct our objects\r \r and like you said you can go back from an our data frame\r \r to a Javascript\r \r object\r \r with the either 2 object function\r \r or if you want to go more the d3 route that would be the the 2 d three function in Javascript so\r \r that's exciting because to me that makes it feel you know much more\r \r our framework as well. It kinda feels a little,\r \r I've been watching a lot of the observable\r \r project\r \r and they have some some excellent,\r \r utilities, blog post documentation around how to sort of convert back and forth between either pandas data frames, our data\r \r frames, and you know the JavaScript data frames that really power the visuals,\r \r on that platform. So this sort of reminds me of that in terms of how easy it is to go back and forth between the 2, and I think that that ease of use is really going to go a long way towards helping people get up to speed and build\r \r tools,\r \r within\r \r the WebR framework. So very very excited.\r \r\n\nThanks to to all who work on this. There's a fantastic acknowledgment section\r \r at the bottom of this and and a lot of familiar names there of folks who are are working hard to continue to drive this this forward and, you know, especially thanks to to George Stagg for sort of spearheading all of this and putting the blog post together.\r \r\n\n[00:34:15] \r Eric Nantz"

Just like how you might miss some very snazzy visuals that we're gonna talk about on our last highlight today.\r \r And as you know, Mike, you and I can probably sympathize, especially\r \r early on in maybe a data science journey or you're leveraging\r \r Are you hearing about things like the tidyverse, you know, suite of packages for the first time, and you're trying to get a handle on a lot of these operations\r \r that occur\r \r when you want to manipulate your data frames like adding new variables,\r \r doing transposing,\r \r you know, doing group summaries.\r \r\n\nA lot of people, myself included, do like to have a nice visual to accompany\r \r maybe the text around just what those particular functions are doing.\r \r Well, we're happy to share that Andrew Hice\r \r has authored a latest blog post\r \r on visualizing\r \r many of the important\r \r dplyr functions\r \r with both,\r \r single group as well as multiple group processing.\r \r And not just having static pictures, folks,\r \r he has handcrafted\r \r some absolutely amazing animations\r \r to go with this. I can I can imagine\r \r he is making heavy use of this in his statistics,\r \r lectures and his coursework?\r \r\n\nBut, yeah, of course, we're we're in an audio podcast talking about visuals here, but boy oh boy,\r \r you look at these and how he made them, first off, is that\r \r he tried to leverage what Garrigade and Bowie, from has built\r \r with his custom visuals in the tidy explain package, but he was running into a couple limitations.\r \r I'll be especially around the group processing.\r \r So Andrew is showing his, graphical editing shops here,\r \r has built custom Adobe Illustrator\r \r powered visuals and after effects.\r \r But guess what? He's actually shared the the files that if you have the software,\r \r you go import this in and try it yourself.\r \r\n\nI I'm not an Adobe customer, so I can't exactly run this myself. But, hey, it's there if you have that\r \r same software.\r \r But throughout the blog posts, he's got not just the narrative of what a function does such as mutate.\r \r You can simply hit play in the blog post and then see\r \r literally the transformation\r \r of that data with this nice transition kind of layout from left to right with new variables or new records\r \r being colored the same as the new code snippet that's being shown on the right\r \r side. It is very easy to digest.\r \r It does as a mutate with summarize,\r \r and then where it really starts to shine is the grouping visuals. Or now, if you're grouping by a categorical variable,\r \r he's able to separate these blocks out logically\r \r and then really show the impact of that operation\r \r and then be able to ungroup that at the end to get that\r \r original setback\r \r or things like that. And also custom mutations within groups. So he's got the code snippets\r \r alongside the visuals. Again,\r \r really great to digest visually\r \r what is happening here. And, boy, I wish I'd had this when I was learning the manipulation\r \r in the old days. But, of course, in my day, not to be that guy saying get off my lawn, we didn't have Dplyr back then. We had Plyr midway through my hour journey, and that did not have nearly the resources\r \r that dplyr has both under the hood as well as in\r \r educational materials.\r \r\n\nBut, again, the visuals really do a terrific job of really isolating the key\r \r incremental\r \r steps\r \r in these operations, which I think you can see it in a pipeline operation\r \r just with the text.\r \r But seeing that visual paired with it, you really start to see what is the impact\r \r of each of those statements.\r \r So there is a whole lot to digest here. We definitely invite you to check out the post because our ramblings can only do us so much justice,\r \r But, kudos kudos to Andrew\r \r for handcrafting\r \r all this from the ground up. It is truly amazing stuff.\r \r\n\n[00:39:28] \r Mike Thomas"

It's a little straightforward, but once you start getting into\r \r grouping by aggregation,\r \r summarization,\r \r doing a mutate on a grouped data frame, joins,\r \r things like that, It it, you know, takes it to an additional\r \r level of, you know, abstraction\r \r that can be difficult to wrap your head around when you're when you're a beginner.\r \r\n\nAnd back in my day, Eric, it was, Excel pivot tables. That's how I first got my my start in, you know, understanding some of these concepts and then I had to bring it over, to the our side and I was like, wow. Hey, you know, this is a, maybe a hot take a little bit but\r \r what has a better expressive syntax to tell you exactly what it's doing,\r \r than dplyr\r \r and the tidyverse.\r \r I don't think there's anything else out there.\r \r Sure surely a whole lot better than Excel.\r \r I I can at least tell you that much in in terms of just being able to to look at the code, you know, I think SQL is probably a close second, but to be able to look at the code and understand sort of exactly\r \r what's going on and, you know, these examples applied to data,\r \r I think are fantastic. These these visuals go such a long way towards building that understanding\r \r as well because you can\r \r he's really representing sort of the the action\r \r taking place here, whether it be grouping, summarization,\r \r or a mutate.\r \r\n\nSo,\r \r yeah. Hats off to him. I would say that that\r \r his work\r \r doing this, he may not realize just how\r \r impactful this might be on his\r \r students or, you know, folks learning r who stumble across this blog post. So if you if you know someone,\r \r who's who's trying to learn r having a tough time,\r \r you know, first point them to the Tidyverse. That would be my recommendation\r \r to wrap their head around dang data wrangling, but I think this is going to be a fantastic blog post to to point people to\r \r as well, to help them get up to speed, to help them sort of get over the hump, right, in building their understanding of data manipulation in R. So I I really just can't understate, you know, I've said it a few times now, but I can't understate sort of the importance\r \r of this and, how useful\r \r I think this type of visual\r \r instruction can be.\r \r\n\n\n\n[00:42:03] \r Eric Nantz"
