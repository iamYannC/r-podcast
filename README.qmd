## A fun mini-project scraping the r-weekly highlight podcast.

This is an educational and open-source project. Users are encouraged to maintain ethical standards when accessing the information. If you find anything interesting, feel free to submit a PR or contact me :)

I am not an official member of the r-weekly team, everything that you find here is un-related to the podcast/weekly highlights team.

### Personally, I exercised the following:

-   Scraping using rvest, CSS selectors and XML paths
-   Automation using GitHub actions. Scraper runs every Monday at Midnight (UTC) - check `auto.yaml` for the exact details.

### There are 3 R files:

-   `r weekly podcast scrape` - main script
-   `r weekly podcast scrape - followup` - Minor analysis. subject to many changes
-   `auto workflow` - The activation file. If a new episode is detected, runs both scripts to update 3 Output files:
    -   A JSON file
    -   An XLSX file with multiple tabs
    -   An RDS file

#### Here is a preview of how the XL Workbook looks like.

Note the tabs. each corresponds to a different part of the episode and can be easily joined via primary key ep_name (episode name).
